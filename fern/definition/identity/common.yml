  GlobalEventNotification:
    docs: |
      Notifications represent information that should be presented to the user
      immediately.
      At the moment, only chat message events have associated notifications.
      # Display
      Notifications should be displayed in an unobtrusive manner throughout the
      entire game. Notifications should disappear after a few seconds if not
      interacted with.
      # Interactions
      If your platform supports it, notifications should be able to be clicked or
      tapped in order to open the relevant context for the event.
      For a simple implementation of notification interactions, open `url` in a
      web browser to present the relevant context. For example, a chat message
      notification will open the thread the chat message was sent in.
      For advanced implementations that implement a custom chat UI, use
      `GlobalEvent.kind` to determine what action to take when the notification is interacted with. 
      For example, if the global event kind is `GlobalEventChatMessage`, then open
      the chat UI for the given thread.
