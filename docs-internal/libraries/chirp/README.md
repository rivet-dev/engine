## What is Chirp?

Chirp is the system used to communicate between Rivet services. It's built on top of NATS and Redis Streams.
All communication over Chirp is encoded with Protobuf.

## Service types

**TLDR**

- Operations don't mutate databases and can fail. Think of them similar HTTP `GET` requests.
- Workers make changes to databases and retry upon failure. Think of them similar to HTTP
  `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` requests.

### Operations

_Often referred to as `ops`._

Operations are the most common type of service in Rivet.

Operations are used for requests that don't have permanent side effects (e.g. write to a database, making
destructive API calls). They're commonly used for "getters" that execute database queries.

**Writing operations**

1. Create the Protobuf interface under `packages/services/*/types/my_operation.proto`
2. Create a library under `packages/services/*/ops/my-operation`
3. Write the operation body under `src/main.rs`
4. Write tests for the operation under `tests/`

**Calling operations**

1. Add a dependency to the operation in the service's `Cargo.toml`
2. Call the operation using
   ```rust
   op!([ctx] my_operation {}).await?
   ```

**Operations as libraries**

Rivet is designed around the philosophy of "build libraries, not microservices."

Each operation is an independent Rust micro-library that depends on other operations as libraries. When you
see `op!` used in the code, it's calling a plain old function under the hood.

This provides the benefits of explicit isolation & testability of each operation without creating complicated
& wasteful systems for microservices.

**Error handling**

Operations can return errors which will be propagated up the call stack. These get converted in to HTTP errors
if originating from an API request.

See the [error handling guide](/docs/chirp/ERROR_HANDLING.md) for more details.

### Workers

Workers are used for two main use cases:

- Performing operations that have permanent side effects (e.g. writing to a database, making destructive API
  calls)
- Consuming & responding to events (e.g. executing code when a user follows another user)

**Writing workers**

You'll usually need to create a new message for this worker. Do this first.

1. Create a worker under `packages/services/*/worker/src/workers/my_worker.rs`
2. Register the worker under `packages/services/*/worker/src/main.rs`

**Messages**

Workers are triggered by (or in other words, "consume") messages through an event-based architecture.

Most workflows inside of Rivet are performed using a
[choreography](https://solace.com/blog/microservices-choreography-vs-orchestration/).

This has many benefits, among which are:

- **Interoperability & extensibility** Workers can hook in to events from other parts of the code to add
  additional functionality, without modifying other services. For example:
  - The Rivet matchmaker is built on top of the abstract job event system without the job package knowing
    anything about the matchmaker.
  - The Rivet party system hooks in to the matchmaker event lifecycle to provide extra functionality without
    modifying the matchmaker at all.
- **Resilience** A lot of things can cause services to fail, like database failures, buggy deploys, and
  unexpected panics. Choreographed systems can recover from failures because they are stateless. As opposed to
  orchestration with a master server, which can crash and cause systems to fail.
- **Real-time by default** Since every step of a process is triggered by an event, systems are able to display
  real time results easily by hooking in to events from API services.
- **Simplicity** Event-based architectures has purely functional consumers with a clear input, output, and
  explicit list of messages it can publish. This makes it easy to determine what a service can do and how it
  can fail.

**Queuing**

Workers are processed in a queue. This makes them suitable for expensive and long-lasting operations.

**Error handling**

Errors thrown by workers do not propagate back to whichever service created the message. If a worker throws an
error, then the worker will be retried with exponential back off until it succeeds.

If you want to be able to catch erroneous behavior from a worker, you need to create an error message type for
the worker (e.g. `packages/services/team/types/msg/create-fail.proto`) and explicitly publish said message upon
erroneous behavior.

> The reason the term "erroneous behavior" is used instead of just "error" is because when workers error
> "normally", they back off and then retry as noted above. Erroneous behavior is anything that doesn't cause
> the worker to retry (so technically it succeeds), but sends message back to the service that published the
> initial message and allows it to handle that error itself.

Internal errors like database errors should not be transmitted back to the initial service, since workers
should retry these types of requests.

See the [error handling guide](/docs/chirp/ERROR_HANDLING.md) for more details.

In code, this is what a worker with error message pattern might look like:

- **Initiator** (some other service)

  ```rust
  let create_res = msg!([ctx] team::msg::create(team_id) -> Result<team::msg::create_complete, team::msg::create_fail> {
      // ... message body
  })
  .await?;
  match create_res {
      Ok(complete_msg) => {
          // No error
      }
      Err(fail_msg) => {
          let code = team::msg::create_fail::ErrorCode::from_i32(fail_msg.error_code);

          // Handle error
      }
  };
  ```

  or

  ```rust
  let complete_res = msg!([ctx] team::msg::create(team_id) -> Result<team::msg::create_complete, team::msg::create_fail> {
      // ... message body
  })
  .await??; // Note the double `?`
  ```

- **Worker**

  ```rust
  if fail_condition {
      msg!([ctx] team::msg::create_fail(team_id) {
          error_code: team::msg::create_fail::ErrorCode::ValidationFailed as i32,
      })
      .await?;

      // Note here that the worker itself does not fail, it simply sends back a fail message upon erroneous behavior.
      return Ok(());
  } else {
      msg!([ctx] team::msg::create_complete(team_id) {
          // ... message body
      })
      .await?;
  }
  ```

**Completion messages**

It's a common pattern to publish a separate completion message when a worker finishes.

For example, the `user-create` worker publishes the `msg-user-create-complete` message once complete. API
servers consume this message to know when to return a `200 OK` from the request.

### Messages

Messages are a used to represent events or to trigger workers.

**Publishing messages**

Messages can be published using the `msg!` macro.

Messages are encode to Protobuf blobs that get written to both Redis Streams and NATS.

**Subscribing to messages**

Services can subscribe to messages by using the `subscribe!` macro.

This subscribes to the NATS topic to receive the message in realtime.

To publish a message and subscribe at the same time, the `msg!` macro has various syntaxes to make this
cleaner. See `lib/chirp/client/src/macros.rs` for more info.

**Workers for consuming messages**

Workers can be created to consume messages. For example, a `user-create` worker can be created to consume the
`msg-user-create` and the publish the `msg-user-create-complete` message.

## Service sizes

Services are designed to be as small as possible.

Refrain from creating monolithic services that do everything with a complicated request.

This helps encourage thorough unit tests, isolation & reproducibility of errors, and makes services easier to
comprehend.
