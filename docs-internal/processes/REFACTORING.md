# Refactoring

In an ideal world, systems are designed well and tested thoroughly before merging. But life happens, and
refactoring is a reality we have to deal with.

## Hard parts of refactoring

- Merge conflicts with other team members
- Re-educating team members
- Breaking changes

## Tips for refactoring

- **Automation** If making changes that will affect other team members, try writing a script to perform the
  refactor in case new code gets written by other members that needs to be refactored
- **Documentation** Write a document on what changed in the refactor and mention team members
