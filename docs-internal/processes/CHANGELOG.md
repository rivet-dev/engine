# Changelog

Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date. This will be used to publish our weekly updates.

**Why not use tickets & PRs as a changelog?**

Tickets and PRs are great internally for people who know the Rivet codebase inside and out. Changelogs are where these changes are communicated clearly to the public who doesn't contribute to Rivet.

**Resources**
