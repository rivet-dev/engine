# Timeouts

Many load balancers have 60s configured as default timeout. Our API timeouts are designed to work within these
bounds.

## Preface: How network reaches Rivet

```
Client -> Cloudflare -> NLB -> Traefik -> api-monolith
```

## Infra timeouts

These are the timeouts that our API servers are restricted to:

- Cloudflare: 100s
  ([source](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-5xx-errors/#error-524-a-timeout-occurred))
  - **Behavior** Returns a 524
  - Cannot be configured unless paying for Cloudflare Enterprise
- AWS NAT Gateway: 350 seconds idle (without keepalive)
  ([source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-troubleshooting.html#nat-gateway-troubleshooting-timeout))
  - **Behavior** Connection drop
- AWS NLB: 350 seconds
  ([source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/network-load-balancers.html#connection-idle-timeout))
  - **Behavior** Connection drop
- Traefik: 60s, 120s
  ([source](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/blob/c63067ce6e81f97b435e424e576fbd922b14f748/infra/tf/k8s_infra/traefik.tf#L65))
  - **Behavior** _Unknown_
  - Unlike the other timeouts, this is configurable by us
  - 60s timeout for active requests before traefik stops
  - 120s timeout for reading the body and writing the response
- ATS (Through Traefik): 15s
  ([source](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/blob/01-26-Add_timeouts_max_in_flight_compression_to_API_and_CDN/infra/tf/k8s_infra/traffic_server.tf#L313))
  - **Behavior** _Unknown_

## Rivet API Timeouts

We use long polling (i.e. `watch_index`) to implement real time functionality. This means we need to be
cautious about existing timeouts.

Current timeouts:

- `api-helper`: 50s
  ([source](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/blob/9811ae11656d63e26b4814fe15f7f852f5479a48/lib/api-helper/macros/src/lib.rs#L975))
  - **Behavior** Returns `API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`
  - **Motivation** This gives a 10s budget for any other 60s timeout
- `select_with_timeout!`: 40s
  ([source](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/blob/9811ae11656d63e26b4814fe15f7f852f5479a48/lib/util/macros/src/lib.rs#L12))
  - **Behavior** Timeout handled by API endpoint, usually 200
  - **Motivation** This gives a 10s budget for any requests before/after the select statement
- `tail!` and `tail_all!`: 40s (depending on `TailAllConfig`)
  ([source](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/blob/9811ae11656d63e26b4814fe15f7f852f5479a48/lib/util/macros/src/lib.rs#L12))
  - **Behavior** Timeout handled by API endpoint, usually 200
  - **Motivation** This gives a 10s budget for any requests before/after the select statement

## Database connections

### CockroachDB

- `idle_timeout` is set to 3 minutes, which is less than the NAT Gateway timeout
- `test_before_acquire` is left as true in order to ensure we don't run in to timeouts, even though this adds
  significant overhead

### Redis

- We ping the database manually every 15 seconds
- Back off retries is set to infinity in order to ensure that `ConnectionManager` always returns to a valid
  state no matter the connection issues
  - The current internal logic will cause the Redis connection to fail after 6 automatic disconnects, which
    will cause the cluster to fail if idle for too long
