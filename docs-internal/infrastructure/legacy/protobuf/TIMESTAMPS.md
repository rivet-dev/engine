# Timestamp

## Storing as `sint64`

Proto timestamps were originally stored as `uint64` but changed to `int64` to allow for storage of negative
timestamps (i.e. for birthdays before 1970).

All new timestamps should use the type `sint64` due to its increased efficiency in comparison to `int64`.

The reason `uint64` types were not converted to `sint64` types is because the two types are not in-place
compatible.
