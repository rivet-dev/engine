# Memory

The Memory driver stores all actor state and communication in memory, making it ideal for testing, development, and prototyping scenarios where persistence is not required.

<Info>
The Memory driver does not persist data between server restarts. For production applications that need to scale horizontally across multiple machines, see [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting)
</Info>

## Feature Support

| Feature | Supported |

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install packages">

The Memory driver is included with `rivetkit` - no additional packages needed:

```bash
npm install rivetkit
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the driver">

Create and use the Memory driver:

```typescript {{"title":"server.ts"}}
import { createMemoryDriver } from "rivetkit";
import { registry } from "./registry";

const driver = createMemoryDriver();
const { client } = registry.start({ driver });

// ...rest of your server...
```

The Memory driver requires no configuration options.
