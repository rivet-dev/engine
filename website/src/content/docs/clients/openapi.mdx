# OpenAPI

The Rivet OpenAPI spec is available [here](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivetkit/blob/main/clients/openapi/openapi.json)

<Note>The OpenAPI spec currently only exposes creating & managing actors. It does not expose how to communicate with actors. See the [HTTP client implementation](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivetkit/blob/b5072fdac18d90a27bb6cd36e9ee73b00d36d42c/packages/rivetkit/src/client/actor-handle.ts) for reference.</Note>
