# SQLite-on-the-Server Is Misunderstood: Better At Hyper-Scale Than Micro-Scale

<Lead>
  We're Rivet, a new open-source, self-hostable serverless platform. We've been in the weeds with SQLite-on-the-server recently and – boy – do we have a lot of thoughts to share. [Give us a star on GitHub](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet), we'll be sharing a lot more about SQLite soon!
</Lead>

There's been [a lot of discussion](https://lobste.rs/s/t1enph/siren_call_sqlite_on_server) recently about the pros and cons of SQLite on the server. After reading many of these conversations, I realized that my perspective on the power of SQLite-on-the-server is lopsided from popular opinion: SQLite's strengths really shine at scale, instead of with small hobbyist deployments that it's frequently referenced in.

## Background

Before jumping in to my perspective on the benefits of SQLite at scale, it's helpful to understand some background on SQLite-on-the-server for micro-scale apps.

### Why Developers Love SQLite for Micro-Scale Deployments

<Image src={SqliteMicroscale} />

Most developers consider server-side SQLite a simple, cost-effective choice for small-scale applications. It's often valued for:

- **Low infrastructure costs**: No need for separate database servers—just a single file.
- **Seamless development and testing**: The same database file can be used across client and server.
- **Minimal management overhead**: No complex configurations or database daemons.
- **Proven reliability**: It's been around forever. It's the [world's most widely deployed database](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) and [built to withstand battleships getting blown to bits](https://hackernoon.com/the-story-of-dwayne-richard-hipp-and-the-development-of-sqlite-in-1999-yc4v356q).

These characteristics make SQLite an attractive option for personal projects, lightweight applications, and prototypes.

### Tools for SQLite-on-the-server

Tools like [LiteFS](https://github.com/superfly/litefs), [Litestream](https://litestream.io/), [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite), [Dqlite](https://dqlite.io/), and [Bedrock](https://bedrockdb.com/) enhance SQLite with replication and high availability for micro-scale deployments.

However, this post focuses on [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/get-started/tutorial-with-sql-api/) and [Turso](https://turso.tech/) to highlight the often-overlooked advantages of SQLite at scale.

## Databases at Hyper-Scale Today: Sharded Databases & Partitioning Keys

<Image src={Cassandra} />

In high-scale systems, companies frequently struggle scaling databases like [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). Instead, they often turn to sharded databases such as [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Vitess](https://vitess.io/) (sharded MySQL), and [Citus](https://www.citusdata.com/) (sharded Postgres).

These systems use partitioning keys to co-locate related & similarly structured data. For example, a typical chat application on Cassandra might define:

```sql {{ "title": "schema.cql" }}
CREATE TABLE chat_channel (
    -- Partition Key: Groups all messages for a single chat in the same partition
    channel_id UUID,

    -- Clustering Key: Orders messages within the chat (think ORDER BY)
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    message_id UUID,

    -- Row data
    message TEXT,

    PRIMARY KEY (channel_id, sent_at, message_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (sent_at ASC, message_id ASC);
```

To query messages from this partition, you could write:

```sql {{ "title": "query.cql" }}
SELECT * FROM user_chat WHERE channel_id = ? ORDER BY sent_at ASC, message_id ASC;
```

### Benefits of Sharded Databases

Sharded databases power almost every large tech company because they provide:

- Efficient batch reads with data grouped in the same partition.
- Horizontal scalability by partitioning data across nodes.
- Optimized writes for high-ingestion workloads

<Tip>
  Apple runs the world's largest known number of Cassandra/ScyllaDB instances [with roughly 300,000 nodes as of 2022](https://x.com/erickramirezau/status/1578063811495477248). Almost all large companies have shared that they also run massive clusters of partitioned databases in the thousands of nodes.
</Tip>

### Challenges with Current Partitioning Solutions

While partitioning strategies improve scalability, they introduce significant challenges:

- **Rigid schemas**: Unlike Postgres or MySQL, the schema must exactly match the intended query patterns exactly, limiting flexibility.
- **Complex schema changes**: Adding a new index or relation requires significant operational overhead to create & populate a new table in a live system.
- **Complex cross-partition operations**: Enforcing ACID properties across partitions is difficult. Companies often resort to complicated [two-phase commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol) or design with an acceptable level of data inconsistency.
- **Data inconsistency**: Without strong constraints between tables & partitions, data frequently becomes "dirty" because of interrupted transactions or failure to propagate changes.

## Enter SQLite at Scale: Cloudflare Durable Objects & Turso

 [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/get-started/tutorial-with-sql-api/) and [Turso](https://turso.tech/) demonstrate how SQLite will change how hyper-scale applications may be architected in the future.

These databases provide:

- **Dynamic scaling**: Instantly provision databases per entity, reducing infrastructure complexity.
- **Infinite, cheap databases**: Similar to partitions, you can spawn an infinite number of SQLite databases because they are incredibly cheap to create & manage.
- **Global distribution**: Databases are placed closer to users, improving query performance.
- **Built-in replication and durability**: Unlike traditional SQLite, these services replicate data across multiple regions for high availability.

### A Better Hyper-Scale Database: SQLite Database Per Partition

<Image src={SqliteHyperscale} />

Using SQLite with Cloudflare Durable Objects & Turso allows defining databases per entity, effectively replacing partitioning keys.

Instead of storing chat logs in a single partition, each chat channel can have its own SQLite database that also includes more tables, like participants and reactions. A sample schema could look like this:

```sql {{ "title": "schema.sql" }}
-- Notice there is no channel_id in this table, since all of this data is local
-- to a single SQLite database per channel.
--
-- The channel ID will be specified when defining which Durable Object to
-- connect to below (see )`CHAT_DO.idFromName(channelId)` below.
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  sender_id UUID,
  message TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX ON messages (sent_at ASC);

CREATE TABLE participants (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  joined_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

From Cloudflare Durable Objects or Turso, this SQLite partition database could be queried like this:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript {{ "title": "cloudflare_worker.js" }}
// This Durable Object represents one partition
//
// It contains a completely isolated SQLite database
export class ChatChannel extends DurableObject {
  async getMessages() {
    // Execute query
    let result = this.ctx.storage.sql.exec('SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY sent_at ASC').one();
    return result;
  }
}

function getMessages(channelId: string) {
  // Here, the channel ID corresponds to the database partition
  const id = env.CHAT_CHANNEL_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName(channelId);
  const channelDurableObject = c.env.CHAT_CHANNEL_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(id);

  // Execute the query
  return await channelDurableObject.getMessages();
}
```

```javascript {{ "title": "turso.js" }}
import { createLibsqlClient } from "@libsql/client";
import { createApiClient } from "@tursodatabase/api";

const api = createApiClient(/* ... */);

function getMessages(channelId: string) {
  // Each database represents one partition
  //
  // This gets an existing channel and connects to it
  const { hostname } = await api.databases.retrieve(`channel-${channelId}`);
  const db = createLibsqlClient({
    url: `libsql://${hostname}`,
    authToken: "..."
  });

  // Execute query
  const result = await turso.execute("SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY sent_at ASC");

  return result.rows;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Benefits of SQLite-Per-Partition

- **Local ACID transactions**: Complex SQL queries can be within each partition without cross-partition complexities.
- **Efficient I/O**: SQLite enables performing complex queries within the partition with very high performance.
- **Leverage existing SQLite extensions**: SQLite has a rich ecosystem of existing extensions, such as [FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html), [JSON1](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [R*Tree](https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html), and [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index).
- **Full Power of SQL migrations**: SQLite provides the full power of SQL migrations & leveraging existing migrations tools such as Drizzle & Prisma.
- **Lazy schema migrations**: Changing schema is tricky at scale. Assuming your migrations are lightweight, they can be executed on demand after the SQLite database is opened at the cost of a slightly higher p99 after deploys.

<Tip>
**Who are the Turso founders?** It's no coincidence that the founders of Turso used to work at ScyllaDB, where they saw firsthand the complexities of large-scale partitioned databases on a daily basis.
</Tip>

## Where SQLite Still Falls Short

Despite its benefits, SQLite at scale presents a few challenges:

- Lack of an open-source, self-hosted solution.
- No built-in cross-database querying, making complex analytics difficult without a dedicated data lake.
- Limited database tooling, such as SQL browsers, ETL pipelines, monitoring, and backups. [StarbaseDB](https://starbasedb.com/) is addressing this for Cloudflare Durable Objects with SQLite.
- Non-standard protocols for communicating with SQLite-on-the-server. In contrast, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Cassandra all have a well standardized wire protocols across all cloud providers that has led to a rich community of tools.
- There are no case studies like Cassandra & DynamoDB have of using SQLite with this architecture at hyper-scale. This will change with time.
