# Self-Host Rivet on Railway

Rivet is now a verified app on the Railway Marketplace. With a few clicks, you can deploy and self-host Rivet on Railway and start building stateful apps anywhere you can run Node.js or Bun—without vendor lock-in.

## What’s New with Railway

- **One-click deploy**: Spin up Rivet on Railway in seconds.  
- **Two templates**: [Rivet Starter](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet-starter) with example app; [Rivet](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet) blank template to start fresh.  
- **Full Rivet Engine**: Actors, state, routing, and persistence.  
- **Inspector included**: Real-time actor visibility out of the box.


## Why Rivet?

**Open-source alternative to Durable Objects**  
Durable-Objects-style per-key isolation with portability: run it yourself, keep control of runtime, data, and costs.

**Actors**  
Each Actor owns a key (e.g., a user, room, cart) with single-threaded execution, in-memory state, and persistence. That means no ad-hoc locks, no “who owns this?” routing, and no bolt-on caches.

**Built-in visibility**  
Rivet Inspector gives live views of Actor state, messages, and performance for fast debugging.


## How to build with Actors

**AI Agents**  
- Per-agent memory lives in the Actor (no external cache glue).  
- Tool calls/workflows run sequentially in one place—no race conditions.  
- Simple long-running steps via Actor messages and scheduled work.

**Real-Time & Collaboration**  
- Make each room/document a single Actor: ordered events, membership, and presence in one spot.  
- Broadcast to clients from the room Actor (predictable fan-out, no custom pub/sub scaffolding).  

**Stateful APIs**  
- One Actor per entity (user/cart/session).  
- Built-in idempotency per key (retries don’t double-apply).  
- Consistent read-modify-write without database locks.

**Distributed Workflows**  
- Decompose by key; Actors communicate via messages instead of shared locks.  
- Timers/scheduled work per Actor for sagas and retries.  
- Horizontal scale by sharding keys—no global coordination layer.
