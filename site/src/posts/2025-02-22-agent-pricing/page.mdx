# Why Actors Crush Lambda & Redis for AI Agents (With Real Numbers)

When deploying AI agents in production, one of the most critical decisions you'll face is how to manage conversation state and context. Let's explore how different infrastructure choices affect your agent's capabilities, costs, and development complexity.

## 🤖 Understanding AI Agent Requirements

State management for AI agents has unique characteristics:
- **Maintains conversation history**
- **Tracks context efficiently**
- **Stores embeddings for semantic search**
- **Ensures low-latency responses**
- **Manages both short-term and long-term memory**

## ✅ Making the Right Choice

| Aspect | Rivet Actors | Redis/MemoryDB | Postgres |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Development Complexity** | 🟢 Easiest (managed) | 🟡 Moderate | 🔴 Complex |
| **Operational Requirements** | 🟢 Fully managed | 🟡 Needs monitoring | 🔴 Needs maintenance |
| **Cost Structure** | 🟢 Linear scaling | 🟡 Base costs | 🔴 Best for structure |
| **Data Requirements** | 🟢 128MB per actor | 🟡 Large active state | 🔴 Best for analytics |

## How is Rivet so cheap?

Rivet achieves its low operational costs through an efficient architecture that combines 
compute and state management within a unified actor model. By integrating compute (i.e., “RPC”) 
with data (i.e., “state”), performance is significantly improved. This design eliminates the need 
for external state management systems, reducing both complexity and expenses. Additionally, Rivet’s use of 
V8 isolates and the Deno runtime ensures lightweight, high-performance execution environments, further minimizing 
resource consumption. The platform’s ability to automatically scale to zero during inactivity means that resources 
are only utilized when necessary, leading to cost savings. Moreover, Rivet’s open-source nature allows for self-hosting, 
providing flexibility and control over deployment and associated costs.

## 💡 Optimizing Your AI Agent Deployment

### State Management
- Keep state minimal
- Implement serialization
- Use appropriate storage tiers

### Architecture
- Hybrid approaches can be effective
- Plan for scaling
- Design for fault tolerance

### Cost Optimization
- Monitor usage patterns
- Implement cleanup strategies
- Choose optimal instance sizes

The best solution **often combines multiple approaches**. Start with **Rivet Actors** for simplicity and scale as needed!

🔍 **Always verify pricing before committing.** Small usage changes can significantly impact costs.
