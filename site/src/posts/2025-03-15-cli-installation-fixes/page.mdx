# Rivet CLI Installation Update

We've updated the installation process for the `rivet-cli` package, making it easier than ever to get started with Rivet. This update ensures a seamless setup process whether you're using `npx` or installing globally via `npm`.

## Updates
- Improved installation process for `rivet-cli`
- Streamlined global installation via `npm i -g rivet-cli`

## How to Upgrade

If you installed the CLI previously, you can update it with:

```bash
npm i -g rivet-cli
```

For one-time usage, you can always use:

```bash
npx rivet-cli@latest
```
