# Rivet CLI Installation Fixes

We've resolved installation issues with the `@rivet-gg/cli` package, making it easier than ever to get started with Rivet. This update ensures a seamless setup process whether you're using `npx` or installing globally via `npm`.

## What's Changed?

Previously, some users experienced failures or inconsistencies when installing the CLI via npx or globally via npm. This update ensures both installation methods work reliably across different environments.

### Fixed Issues
- Resolved installation issues with `@rivet-gg/cli`
- Ensured consistent behavior when using `npx @rivet-gg/cli`
- Fixed global installation via `npm i -g @rivet-gg/cli`

## How to Upgrade

If you installed the CLI previously, you can update it with:

```bash
npm update -g @rivet-gg/cli
```

Or perform a fresh installation:

```bash
npm i -g @rivet-gg/cli
```

For one-time usage, you can always use:

```bash
npx @rivet-gg/cli@latest 
```
