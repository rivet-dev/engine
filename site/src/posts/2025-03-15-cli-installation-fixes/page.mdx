# Rivet CLI Installation Updates

We've updated the installation process for the `@rivet-gg/cli` package, making it easier than ever to get started with Rivet. This update ensures a seamless setup process whether you're using `npx` or installing globally via `npm`.

### Updates
- Improved installation process for `@rivet-gg/cli`
- Enhanced consistency when using `npx @rivet-gg/cli`
- Streamlined global installation via `npm i -g @rivet-gg/cli`

## How to Upgrade

If you installed the CLI previously, you can update it with:

```bash
npm update -g @rivet-gg/cli
```

Or perform a fresh installation:

```bash
npm i -g @rivet-gg/cli
```

For one-time usage, you can always use:

```bash
npx @rivet-gg/cli@latest
```
