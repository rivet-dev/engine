# Rivet v2.0 Launch

Today, we are releasing Rivet v2.0.

This release is a complete rework that makes it simpler to build stateful workloads anywhere you can run NodeJS or Bun.

## Major Changes

### Product Layout

- **RivetKit** remains the same as the library for building stateful workloads, with Rivet Actors now being the core primitive.
- **Rivet Engine** remains the core of self-hosting and is used for orchestrating actors at scale.

### BYO DB (Bring Your Own Database)

Rivet v2.0 decouples storage from the platform. The Rivet Engine now supports:
- **PostgreSQL**: For production deployments
- **FoundationDB**: For enterprise-scale distributed systems
- **Filesystem**: For single-node deployments

Actors themselves can use File System or Redis drivers, with more storage options coming soon.

### Deployment Flexibility

Run Rivet in any environment:
- **Local development**: Full functionality on your machine
- **On-premises**: Deploy within your own infrastructure
- **Cloud providers**: Compatible with AWS, Railway, GCP, Azure, and others

### Multi-Region Support

v2.0 introduces multi-region architecture for the Rivet Engine:
- Deploy across multiple geographic locations
- Built for global scale

### Open Source (Apache 2.0)

Rivet v2.0 is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

### Library Architecture

Rivet is now distributed as a library rather than a platform service:
- No external service dependencies
- No vendor lock-in
- Standard npm package installation
- Integrates directly into your application code
