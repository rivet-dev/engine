# Usage-Based Pricing Update

Today we're excited to announce updates to Rivet's pricing model, moving to a more transparent and flexible usage-based system. This change allows developers to better scale their applications while only paying for what they use.

## Key Changes

- **Pay-as-you-go Model**: Only pay for the resources your actors actually consume down to the millisecond
- **Simplified Metrics**: Clear pricing based on:
  - Runtime
  - Bandwidth
  - Storage
- **Free Tier**: Generous free tier for developers and small projects with $5/monthly credit
- **No upfront commitments**: Scale up or down as needed

## Pricing Details

Our new pricing structure is designed to be straightforward and predictable:

- Compute: Actors come with 128MB of memory and cost $0.00000000163/millisecond or $4.29/month
- Bandwidth: 10GB for each Actor pooled, $0.05/GB thereafter
- Storage: 1GB + $0.20/GB month
- Storage Writes: 1M + $1.00/million
- Storage Reads: 1M + $0.20/million
