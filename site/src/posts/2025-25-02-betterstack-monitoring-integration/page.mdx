- **Centralized Logging**: Collect and analyze logs from all your Actors in one place
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create tailored dashboards to visualize performance metrics by lobby ID
- **Real-time Alerts**: Set up notifications for critical events or performance thresholds
- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration with Vector as a log collector and metrics shipper

## Getting Started

To get started with BetterStack monitoring for your Rivet Actors:

1. Create a BetterStack account
2. Configure your project with Vector
3. Deploy your Actor with BetterStack credentials
