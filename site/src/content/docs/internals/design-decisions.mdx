# Design Decisions

This document includes misc design decisions about actors. This document is not relevant to using Rivet, only for curious programmers & potential contributors.

    There is a lot of pseudo-code in this document that is not valid Rivet code.

## Unary RPC + events vs unary/client-streaming/server-streaming/bidirectional RPC

Libraries like gRPC provide 4 types of RPCs for different streaming requirements. 

**Cognitive load**

This design would cause too much cognitive load of getting started with Rivet
too much. While the 4 RPC types are not complicated on their own, developers of
Rivet are already learning about the actor model, so we want to minimize the
amount of new concepts developers have to learn.

**Familiarity with events**

Almost every language - especially JavaScript - uses the `foo.on(event, callback)` pattern frequently. Therefore, designing realtime actor functionality like this is easiest for most developers to understand.

**Complexity compared to events**

For example, just to subscribe to an event, a developer would have to implement a server-streaming RPC & an event system in order to receive realtime events. Additionally, streaming RPCs require much more complicated cleanup code than having a default event system.

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "actor.ts" }}
class Example extends Actor {
    // Fake event system
    eventSystem: EventSystem;

    publishPost(post: UnaryCall<Post>) {
        this.eventSystem.emit("post", post.data)
    }

    subscribeToFeed(ctx: ServerStreamingCall<FeedEvent>): Promise<any> {
        const unsubscribe = eventSystem.on("post", data => {
            ctx.send(data);
        });

        // If you forget this, you'll start leaking subscriptions
        ctx.onclose = () => unsubscribe();
    }
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = /* ... */;
actor.subscribeToFeed(data => {
    console.log("New feed item", data);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

This is significantly more difficult to understand than the equivalent in Rivet:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "actor.ts" }}
class Example extends Actor {
    publishPost(rpc: Rpc<this>, data: Post) {
        this.broadcast("post", data)
    }
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = /* ... */;
actor.on("post", data => {
    console.log("New feed item", data);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parallel RPC handlers vs serial message handlers

Traditional "actors" use "messages" to communicate with actors. (Sometimes messages can have a response, similar to RPCs). The actors usually process messages in serial and can optionally parallelize by spawning background tasks if needed.

Rivet allows RPCs to execute in parallel (though ordering is preserved per-connection).

**Cognitive load**

The primary reason is that writing & understanding Rivet actors is _dead simple_, since calling an RPC looks like calling a method on a class.

Writing a message handler that can do multiple things requires writing an ADT and setting up a loop. Compare the legibility of these two actors:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "message_loop_actor.ts" }}
type Message = 
    | { type: "deposit"; amount: number; replyTo: MessagePort }
    | { type: "withdraw"; amount: number; replyTo: MessagePort }
    | { type: "getBalance"; replyTo: MessagePort };

class UserActor extends Actor {
    private balance = 0;

    async run() {
        while (true) {
            const msg = await this.receiveMessage();
            
            switch (msg.type) {
                case "deposit":
                    this.balance += msg.amount;
                    msg.replyTo.postMessage(this.balance);
                    break;
                
                case "withdraw":
                    if (msg.amount > this.balance) {
                        msg.replyTo.postMessage({ error: "Insufficient funds" });
                    } else {
                        this.balance -= msg.amount;
                        msg.replyTo.postMessage(this.balance);
                    }
                    break;
                
                case "getBalance":
                    msg.replyTo.postMessage(this.balance);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "rpc_actor.ts" }}
class UserActor extends Actor {
    private balance = 0;

    async deposit(rpc: Rpc<this>, amount: number) {
        this.balance += amount;
        return this.balance;
    }

    async withdraw(rpc: Rpc<this>, amount: number) {
        if (amount > this.balance) {
            throw new Error("Insufficient funds");
        }
        this.balance -= amount;
        return this.balance;
    }

    async getBalance(rpc: Rpc<this>) {
        return this.balance;
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The RPC version is much more straightforward to understand and maintain. It looks like normal object-oriented code that most developers are familiar with.

**Accidental performance bottlenecks with serial processing**

If developers use an `await` in an event loop, they'll unintentionally slow down their actor when they don't need to by taking a long time to receive the next message. For example, this code is deceivingly slow:

```typescript
class SlowActor extends Actor {
    private balance = 0;

    async run() {
        while (true) {
            const msg = await this.receiveMessage();
            
            switch (msg.type) {
                case "deposit":
                    // This HTTP request blocks ALL other messages from being processed
                    // until it completes, even though it's not necessary
                    await fetch("https://api.example.com/log-deposit");
                    this.balance += msg.amount;
                    msg.replyTo.postMessage(this.balance);
                    break;
                
                case "getBalance":
                    // This simple request is blocked by the slow deposit above
                    msg.replyTo.postMessage(this.balance);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Opt-in serial message handling**

It's still easy to opt-in to serial message handling if it makes sense. For example:

```typescript
class SerialActor extends Actor {
    private messageQueue = new AsyncQueue();
    private balance = 0;

    constructor() {
        super();
        // Start processing messages in the background
        this.#processMessages();
    }

    // Process messages one at a time
    private async #processMessages() {
        while (true) {
            const message = await this.messageQueue.dequeue();
            await message();
        }
    }

    // Wrap RPC handlers to be processed serially
    async deposit(rpc: Rpc<this>, amount: number) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            this.messageQueue.enqueue(async () => {
                this.balance += amount;
                resolve(this.balance);
            });
        });
    }

    async getBalance(rpc: Rpc<this>) {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            this.messageQueue.enqueue(async () => {
                resolve(this.balance);
            });
        });
    }
}
```

_(Technically this example doesn't need a queue since the queued promises don't do anything async, but the point stands.)_

This implementation maintains the clean RPC interface while ensuring all operations happen serially through a message queue.

## Actor tags vs actor IDs & supervisors

Traditionally, actor systems have an actor ID (i.e. a "process ID" in Erlang) that identifies both the machine & identity where an actor is running. Actor PIDs are managed by "supervisors" that keep track of all of the actors and handle crashes.

**Ease of use of tags**

Actor tags are much easier to read & understand than actor PIDs.

**Rivet durability vs supervisor restarts**

In most actor systems, this restart/reschedule behavior is handled by a supervisor. If an actor restarts or crashes, the supervisor will spawn a new actor and save the new actor ID.

Rivet actors are durable, meaning they will automatically reschedule in case of a failure. This means the location where the actor is running may change without a mechanism to notify all handles of the actor ID.

**Ease of use of durability**

Using tags instead of an actor ID & supervisors is _insanely_ easy to understand. Actors have a few difficult concepts associated with them, taking durability out of the problem makes it easier for more developers to work with actors.

**Supervisors still exist & non-durable actors**

Rivet can run non-durable actors and use the traditional actor model, if needed. This is a core part of how the dedicated game server example works. The matchmaker actor handles the lifecycle of game server actors itself.
