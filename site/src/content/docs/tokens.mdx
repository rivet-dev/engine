# Tokens

Rivet uses tokens for authentication and authorization when interacting with Rivet APIs. This guide explains the different types of tokens, how to generate them, and how to use them securely.

## Types of Tokens

Rivet offers two types of tokens with different permission levels:

### Service Token
- **Purpose**: Runtime API interactions (actors, game services)
- **Scope**: Limited to specific environment (`dev`/`prod`)

#### How to Generate a Service Token
1. Go to your Rivet Dashboard
2. Navigate to Project > Environment > Tokens
3. Under the "Service Token" section, click "Generate"
4. Copy and securely store your token

### Cloud Token
- **Purpose**: Administrative operations (environments, builds, projects)
- **Permissions**: Elevated

#### How to Generate a Cloud Token
1. Go to your Rivet Dashboard
2. Navigate to Project > Settings
3. Under the "Cloud Token" section, click "Generate"
4. Copy and securely store your token

## Using Tokens

Tokens can be used in various ways depending on your development environment and preferred tools.

### JavaScript SDK

To use tokens with the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
import { RivetClient } from "@rivet-gg/api";

const client = new RivetClient({ token: "your_service_token" });
```

### REST API with `curl`

To use tokens with `curl` or other HTTP clients:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $RIVET_SERVICE_TOKEN" 'https://api.rivet.gg/actors?project=my-project&environment=prod'
```

## Rivet Shell

Rivet offers a `rivet shell` command that will auto-create a service token & populate common environment variables for executing commands that depend on tokens.

See the [`rivet shell` documentation](/docs/cli#shell) for more information.
