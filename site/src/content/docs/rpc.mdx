# Remote Procedure Calls

Remote procedure calls (RPC) are how clients communicate with actors. RPCs are as simple as writing a method on the actor class and then calling it from the client.

<Tip>
  RPCs are very lightweight. They can be called hundreds of times per second to send realtime data to the actor.
</Tip>

## Writing RPCs

RPCs can be written as native JavaScript methods on the actor class.

For example, the `multiplyByTwo` method is written as:

```typescript
export class Example extends Actor {
  // This is an RPC
  multiplyByTwo(rpc: Rpc<Example>, x: number) {
    return x * 2;
  }
}
```

### Private methods

Methods starting with `_` or `#` (e.g. `_myMethod` and `#myMethod`) are private and cannot be called by clients.

All Rivet-provided methods start with `_` (e.g. `_broadcast`) so clients cannot call them.

For example:

```typescript
export default class Example extends Actor {
  // This is private and cannot be called by clients
  #calcFibonacci(n: number): number {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return this.#calcFibonacci(n - 1) + this.#calcFibonacci(n - 2);
  }

  // This is public and can be called by clients
  fetchFibonacci(rpc: Rpc<Example>, n: number): number {
    return this.#calcFibonacci(n);
  }
}
```

### Streaming return data

RPCs have a single return value. In order to stream realtime data in response to an RPC, use [events](/docs/events).

## Calling RPCs

Calling RPCs is as simple as calling any other JavaScript function.

```typescript
import type { Counter } from './counter.ts';

const actor = await client.get<Counter>({ name: 'counter' });
await actor.increment(42);
```

<Note>
  Calling RPCs from the client are async and require an `await`, even if the actor's method is not async.
</Note>

### Type safety

The Rivet client includes type safety out of the box. The first generic parameter in `get<Actor>(...)` defines the actor class. You can safely import the actor's type with `import type` in to the client, like this:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
import type { Counter } from './counter.ts';
// ...setup...
const actor = await client.get<Counter>(/* ... */);
await actor.increment(123); // passes
await actor.increment('non-number type'); // compile error
await actor.nonexistentMethod(123); // compile error
```

```typescript {{ "title": "actor.ts" }}
// ...setup...

export class Counter extends Actor {
  increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>, count: number) {
    // ...body...
  }

  // ...etc...
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Schema validation

Data schemas are not validated by default. For production applications, use a library like [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate input types.

In the previous example, providing a non-number value to `count` could corrupt the actor's state (e.g. by passing a string instead of a number). For example, to validate the `increment` request schema:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define schemas for user requests
const IncrementOptionsSchema = z.object({
  count: z.number().int()
});

type IncrementOptions = z.infer<typeof IncrementOptionsSchema>;

export class Counter extends Actor {
  increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>, opts: IncrementOptions) {
    // Will throw error if input is invalid
    const validatedOpts = IncrementOptionsSchema.parse(opts);

    // ...etc...
  }
}
```

## Authentication

By default, clients can call all RPCs on an actor without restriction. Make sure to implement authentication if needed. Documentation on authentication is available [here](/docs/authentication).
