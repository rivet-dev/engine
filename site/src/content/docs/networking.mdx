# Networking

Actor networking is configured with two properties:

1. Network mode (Bridge or Host)
2. Port routing (Rivet Guard or Host)

## Network Modes

### Bridge

Bridge networking maps a random port on the host to the chosen port number for
your actor. Ports can only be access over the LAN. All inbound traffic to actors
using bridge networking must be routed through Rivet Guard (see below).

Actors in bridge networking have isolated network namespaces and cannot
interfere with other actor's networking.

For containers, Rivet uses <Link href='https://www.cni.dev/'>CNI</Link> on our
actor servers to provide bridged port access to any ports chosen by the user. It
maps a randomly chosen port number on the host machine to the chosen port number
by you.

Bridge networking is currently not implemented for isolates.

### Host

_Requires enterprise or self-hosted cluster._

Host networking allows direct access to host ports on our actor servers with the drawback that you cannot
choose a specific port number. Port numbers will be randomly chosen for you for each port. To read the
port number in your application, there are environment variables provided with the port name and number
(ex. `PORT_MY_PORT=24020`).

Containers with host networking have no restriction on what ports they can listen on
and connect to. This is less secure than using bridge networking.

For isolates, Rivet restricts what ports an isolate can listen on.

Host networking is sometimes required for edge cases where actors need an
unrestricted amount of ports. It's up to the developer to ensure that multiple
actors on the same machine do not interfere with each others' networking.

## Port Routing

### Rivet Guard (RG)

Rivet Guard provides DDoS mitigation, automatic SSL management, monitoring, and
more out of the box with negligible added latency. Use Rivet Guard for your
application whenever possible for production applications.

Rivet Guard is a system of servers that proxies end-user connections through itself before connecting to the
actor servers running your application over LAN. This provides DDoS protection with little to no added latency.

Rivet Guard ports cannot be accessed from requests made directly to the actor server over WAN, only through a Rivet
Guard server over LAN.

Rivet Guard routing can be used with either host or bridge network modes.

### Host

_Requires enterprise or self-hosted cluster._

Host ports do not provide any proxying between the end-user and your application and **is not enabled on
production Rivet servers**. This is primarily an option for <Link href='/docs/self-hosting'>self hosting</Link> Rivet.

It recommended to use Rivet Guard whenever possible for production applications
to better protect from DDoS attacks & improve monitoring of your application.

If using host ports, read about differences in behavior with [actor rescheduling](/docs/rescheduling).

## Endpoint Type

### Host

<Note>"Host endpoint type" has no association with "host networking" or "host routing" above.</Note>

The host endpoint type uses the `Host` header to route the request to the correct actor. This is the default & recommended method to use for production Rivet clusters.

For example, the URL `c03fc1cf-66dc-4946-9663-eae42a399060-http.actor.45a33878-e0e5-4f6b-8e72-7e9f6c0a306c.rivet.run` would route to the:

- Actor with ID `c03fc1cf-66dc-4946-9663-eae42a399060`
- Port labelled `http`
- Region with ID `45a33878-e0e5-4f6b-8e72-7e9f6c0a306c`

If self-hosting, host endpoints requires [wildcard DNS records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record#:~:text=A%20wildcard%20DNS%20record%20is,example.com%20.) & [wildcard SSL certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/#does-let-s-encrypt-issue-wildcard-certificates).

### Path

The path endpoint type uses the beginning of the request path to route to the correct actor. This should only be used if:

- Self hosting or developing Rivet without a wildcard DNS record (e.g. Rivet Guard running on `127.0.0.1:7080`)
- Rare cases where explicit hostnames need to be whitelisted (e.g. Discord Activities [URL mappings](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping))

<Warning>
  Directing your users to an HTML page with path endpoint type may be a security
  risk. The origin for path endpoint types (`route.actor.{region}.rivet.run`) is
  shared with other actors. This means that all cookies, local/session storage,
  web workers, etc are shared with any other actor running in the same region.

  Use the host endpoint type instead if serving HTML content.
</Warning>

This diagram shows how requests are routed from the end-user to the application running on Rivet based on the
network mode and port routing.
