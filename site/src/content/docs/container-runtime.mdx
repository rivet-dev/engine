# Container Runtime

Rivet supports deploying containerized applications using Docker. Your application can be packaged in a standard Dockerfile, giving you complete flexibility for your runtime environment.

<Tip title="Get Started Faster With ActorCore">
  For getting started quickly using JavaScript, we recommend trying [ActorCore](https://actorcore.org) â€“ our full-stack framework for working with Rivet Actors.
</Tip>

## Basic Setup

### Step 1: Writing a Dockerfile

Create a simple HTTP server in your project:

```javascript {{"file": "server.js"}}
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end("Hello from Rivet Container Actor!");
});

const port = process.env.PORT_HTTP;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

Create a Dockerfile in your project directory:

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Dockerfile" }}
FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Create rivet user and set proper permissions
RUN addgroup -S rivet && \
    adduser -S -G rivet rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER rivet

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Step 2: Deploying a container

Specify the Dockerfile in your `rivet.json`:

```json {{ "title": "rivet.json" }}
{
  "builds": {
    "my-actor": {
      "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    }
  }
}
```

Now deploy your container with:

```sh
rivet deploy
```

### Step 3: Starting an actor

In this step, you're requesting Rivet to launch your containerized application in the cloud:

```typescript
import { RivetClient } from "@rivet-gg/api";

// Initialize the Rivet client with your API token
// You can get this from the Rivet dashboard
const client = new RivetClient({
  token: process.env.RIVET_TOKEN
});

// Create an actor - this launches your container on Rivet's infrastructure
const { actor } = await client.actors.create({
  // Your project and environment IDs from the Rivet dashboard
  project: "your-project-id",
  environment: "your-environment-id",
  body: {
    // Tags help identify this specific actor instance
    // You can query actors by these tags later
    tags: { name: "my-actor" },
    
    // buildTags determine which actor code to run
    // This should match tags in your rivet.json build configuration
    // The current tag is automatically assigned on deploy
    buildTags: { name: "my-actor", current: "true" },
    
    // Network configuration for your actor
    network: {
      ports: {
        http: {
          // The protocol used for communication
          protocol: "https",
        }
      }
    },
    
    // Optional: Specify a region for lower latency to specific users
    // If not specified, Rivet will choose the optimal region
    // region: "atl",
    
    // Container resources specification
    resources: {
      cpu: 1000,       // Number of CPU thousanths of a core
      memory: 1024,    // Memory in MB
    }
  }
});

// The actor.id is a unique identifier for this actor instance
console.log("Created actor:", actor.id);
```

What happens during creation:
- Rivet finds the latest build matching your `buildTags`
- It provisions resources in the specified region (or chooses the best one)
- It starts your container with the provided environment variables
- The container starts running based on your Dockerfile's CMD or ENTRYPOINT

See [actors.create](/docs/api/actors/create) for more options.

### Step 4: Connecting to an actor

Once your container is running, you can access its URL directly from the actor object:

```typescript
// The actor response includes the URL information
// You can access it for any port you configured
const httpUrl = actor.network.ports.http.url;

// The URL is a public endpoint to your actor
console.log("Actor HTTP URL:", httpUrl);

// Use the URL to communicate with your actor
// In this example, we're calling our HTTP server
const response = await fetch(httpUrl);
const text = await response.text();
console.log("Response from actor:", text);
```

What happens during connection:
- Each port configured for your actor gets a unique URL
- These URLs are accessible based on your actor's security settings
- The URL routes to your actor regardless of which region it's in
- For additional security, you can use `getConnection` to generate temporary, authenticated URLs

See [actors.get](/docs/api/actors/get) for more details.

### Step 5: Destroying an actor

When you're finished using the actor, it's important to destroy it to free up resources:

```typescript
// Destroy the actor to free up resources and stop billing
await client.actors.destroy(actor.id, {
  project: "your-project-id",
  environment: "your-environment-id",
});

console.log("Actor destroyed");
```

What happens during destruction:
- Rivet sends a termination signal to your container
- Your container gets a short grace period to clean up resources
- All compute resources associated with the actor are freed
- You stop being billed for the actor's runtime

See [actors.destroy](/docs/api/actors/destroy) for more details.

<Note>
  Always destroy actors when you're done with them to avoid unnecessary costs.
  Actors will continue running and billing will continue until explicitly destroyed.
</Note>

## Configuration Options

When configuring your Docker-based build in `rivet.json`, you have access to the following options under `builds`:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `dockerfile` | Path to the Dockerfile relative to your project | `"Dockerfile"`, `"docker/prod.Dockerfile"` |
| `image` | Use an existing image instead of building | `"node:22-alpine"` |
| `build_path` | Directory containing your build context | `"."`, `"./backend"` |
| `build_target` | Target stage in multi-stage builds | `"production"`, `"development"` |
| `build_args` | Key-value pairs passed as build arguments | `{ "NODE_ENV": "production" }` |

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/config) for all available options.

## Non-Root User Requirement

For security reasons, Rivet containers **cannot run as root**. You must explicitly set a non-root user in your Dockerfile.

Different base images require different commands to create non-root users:

<CodeGroup>

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Alpine Linux" }}
RUN addgroup -S rivet && \
    adduser -S -G rivet rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Ubuntu/Debian" }}
RUN groupadd -r rivet && \
    useradd --no-log-init -r -g rivet rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "RHEL/CentOS/Fedora" }}
RUN groupadd -r rivet && \
    useradd -r -g rivet -s /sbin/nologin rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Arch Linux" }}
RUN groupadd rivet && \
    useradd -m -g rivet -s /bin/bash rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

</CodeGroup>
