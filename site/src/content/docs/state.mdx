# State

Actor state provides the best of both worlds: it's stored in-memory and persisted automatically. This lets you work with the data without added latency while still being able to survive crashes & upgrades.

Actor state is isolated to itself and cannot be accessed from other actors or clients. All reads & writes to state are done via [RPC](/docs/rpc).

There are two ways of storing actor state:

- **Native state** is the most common persistence mechanism. State is a native JavaScript object stored in memory.
- **Key-Value (KV) state** allows you deal with larger datasets than cannot fit in memory.

<Note>
  While Rivet Actors can serve as a complete database solution, they can also
  complement your existing databases effectively. For example, you might use
  Rivet Actors to handle frequently-changing data that needs real-time access,
  while keeping less frequently accessed data in your traditional database.
</Note>

## Native state

State is a native JavaScript object stored in-memory on `this._state`. This makes building realtime & stateful applications as simple as updating native JavaScript objects.

### State type

Actor states can be typed in TypeScript using the first generic argument on `Actor<State>`. For example:

```typescript
interface State {
  count: number;
}

export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  // ...
}
```

### Initializing state

Each requires an `initializeState` method. This is only called once when the actor is created.

For example:

```typescript
interface State {
  count: number;
}

export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  _onInitialize() {
    return { count: 0 };
  }
}
```

### Updating state

State can be updated using `this._state`. State will automatically be persisted.

For example:

```typescript
interface State {
  count: number;
}

export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>) {
    this._state.count += 1;
  }

  // ...
}
```

<Warning>
  Only state stored on the `this._state` property will be persisted. Properties of the `Counter` class are kept
  in-memory and not persisted.
</Warning>

### State saves

Rivet automatically handles persisting state transparently to recover from a crash or upgrade. This happens at the end of every remote procedure call if the state has changed.

In the rare occasion you need to force a state change mid-RPC, you can use `_saveState`. This should only be used if your remote procedure call makes an important state change that needs to be persisted before the RPC exits in case of a crash.

### Valid data types

Only JSON-serializable types can be stored in state. State is persisted under the hood in a compact, binary format. This is because JavaScript classes cannot be serialized & deserialized.

### Limitations

State is constrained to the available memory (see [limitations](/docs/limitations)). For larger datasets, use KV.

## Key-Value (KV)

The KV state is used for storing large datasets that cannot fit in to memory.

Native & KV state can be used together side-by-side without issue..

<Info>
    KV is specific to each actor and is not global. To fetch data from other actors, use [RPC](/docs/rpc).

    If you need a shared state, you have two options:

    1. Create an actor that holds the shared state that actors can make RPCs to
    2. Use an external database, such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

</Info>

### Performance

KV has the same performance as using native state, but with a more flexible API & unlimited storage.

KV stores native JavaScript values in a compact binary format so you don't need to write extra serialization & deserialization code.

### Operations

Raw KV operations can be called via `this.#ctx.kv.<op>`.

#### `get`

  `get(key: any, options?: GetOptions): Promise<any | null>`

  Retrieves a value from the key-value store.

  Options:

  ```js
  {
      format?: "value" | "arrayBuffer";
  }
  ```

#### `getBatch`

  `getBatch(keys: any[], options?: GetBatchOptions): Promise<Map<any, any>>`

  Retrieves a batch of key-value pairs.

  Options:

  ```js
  {
      format?: "value" | "arrayBuffer";
  }
  ```

#### `list`

  `list(options?: ListOptions): Promise<Map<any, any>>`

  Retrieves all key-value pairs in the KV store. When using any of the options, the keys lexicographic order
  is used for filtering.

  Options:

  ```js
  {
      format?: "value" | "arrayBuffer";
      // The key to start listing results from (inclusive). Cannot be used with startAfter or prefix.
      start?: any;
      // The key to start listing results after (exclusive). Cannot be used with start or prefix.
      startAfter?: any;
      // The key to end listing results at (exclusive).
      end?: any;
      // Restricts results to keys that start with the given prefix. Cannot be used with start or startAfter.
      prefix?: any;
      // If true, results are returned in descending order.
      reverse?: boolean;
      // The maximum number of key-value pairs to return.
      limit?: number;
  }
  ```

#### `put`

  `put(key: any, value: any | ArrayBuffer, options?: PutOptions): Promise<void>`

  Stores a key-value pair in the key-value store.

  Options:

  ```js
  {
      format?: "value" | "arrayBuffer";
  }
  ```

#### `putBatch`

  `putBatch(obj: Map<any, any | ArrayBuffer>, options?: PutBatchOptions): Promise<void>`

  Stores a batch of key-value pairs.

  Options:

  ```js
  {
      format?: "value" | "arrayBuffer";
  }
  ```

#### `delete`

  `delete(key: any): Promise<void>`

  Deletes a key-value pair from the key-value store.

#### `deleteBatch`

  `deleteBatch(keys: any[]): Promise<void>`

  Deletes a batch of key-value pairs from the key-value store.

#### `deleteAll`

  `deleteAll(): Promise<void>`

  Deletes all data from the key-value store. **This CANNOT be undone.**

### Keys

Keys used for KV storage can be any JavaScript type that can be cloned via the
[structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm):

```js
let myKey = { foo: ['bar', 2] };

await this.#ctx.kv.put(myKey, [1, 2, 3]);

await this.#ctx.kv.get(myKey); // [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Structured Keys

Structured keys provide security and ease of use for applications with layered storage criteria such as lists
within lists or deeply nested hashmaps.

In general, it is more efficient to your data structure with small chunks in individual keys instead of
all in one key. This is where structured keys come in:

```js
// Entire document in a single key (not recommended)
await this.#ctx.kv.put(["user", "kacper"], {
  inventory: /* ... */,
  stats: /* ... */,
  paymentMethod: /* ... */,
});

// Sharded document using structured keys (arrays)
await this.#ctx.kv.put(["user", "kacper", "inventory"], /* ... */);
await this.#ctx.kv.put(["user", "kacper", "stats"], /* ... */);
await this.#ctx.kv.put(["user", "kacper", "paymentMethod"], /* ... */);
```

It is strongly advised to always use structured keys instead of manually implementing them yourself to reduce
possible attack vectors from end-users:

```js
let userName = /* ... */;

// Manually building keys (**DON'T DO THIS**)
let user = await this.#ctx.kv.get(`user:${userName}`);

// Structured keys
let user = await this.#ctx.kv.get(["user", userName]);
```

The difference here is that with a manual approach it is possible to retrieve data that was otherwise not
public via injection:

```js
// Setting our username to this value lets us access the inventory
// of any user, which should otherwise be private.
let userName = 'nicholas:inventory';

// Manually building keys (**DON'T DO THIS**)
let user = await this.#ctx.kv.get(`user:${userName}`);

// Structured keys automatically provide protection against special
// token boundary attacks
let user = await this.#ctx.kv.get(['user', userName]);
```

Note that single-value keys are automatically converted into single item lists for consistency:

```js
// The same
await this.#ctx.kv.get('my-key');
await this.#ctx.kv.get(['my-key']);
```

#### Sorting Keys

Keys are automatically sorted in [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order).
This means when using the `list` command, you can fetch all values between two keys in order:

```js
// Fetch all users with usernames that start with "k" through "s"
// (note that the end is exclusive, so "t" is not included)
await this.#ctx.kv.list({
  start: ['users', 'k'],
  end: ['users', 't']
});
```

You can also use this to list all values under a common prefix key:

```js
// Fetch all items in a user's inventory
await this.#ctx.kv.list({
  prefix: ['users', 'nathan', 'inventory']
});
```

Sorted keys also enable you to create ordered lists, like this:

```js
// bar posted a score of 88
await this.#ctx.kv.put(["leaderboard", 88], { username: "bar", date: Date.now() });

// foo posted a score of 42
await this.#ctx.kv.put(["leaderboard", 42], { username: "foo", date: Date.now() });

// Returns 88, 42
await this.#ctx.kv.list({
  prefix: ['leaderboard'],
  reverse: true,  // Descending order
});
```

### Values

Values stored in the KV can be any JavaScript type which can be cloned via the
[structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).

To store raw binary data, it is recommended to set the `format` option in your KV operation to `arrayBuffer`
and pass in an `ArrayBuffer` object. Alternatively, you can `put` an `ArrayBuffer` or `Blob` directly without
changing the format but this has additional space overhead from the JS type system.
