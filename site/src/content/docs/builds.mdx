# Builds

Builds contain the code required to run an actor. Builds are uploaded to Rivet when running `rivet deploy`. Each actor is associated with a single build ID.

When a new build is uploaded, all actors are upgraded to use the new build. This process is usually transparent to you since the state is durable.
