# Logging

Actors provide a built-in way to log complex data to the console.

When dealing with lots of data, `console.log` often doesn't cut it. Using `this._log` allows you to log complex data using structured logging.

<Note>Using the actor logging API is completely optional.</Note>

## Log levels

There are 5 log levels:

| Level    | Call                                   | Description                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical | `this._log.critical(message, ...args);` | Severe errors that prevent core functionality                    |
| Error    | `this._log.error(message, ...args);`    | Errors that affect functionality but allow continued operation   |
| Warning  | `this._log.warn(message, ...args);`     | Potentially harmful situations that should be addressed          |
| Info     | `this._log.info(message, ...args);`     | General information about significant events & state changes     |
| Debug    | `this._log.debug(message, ...args);`    | Detailed debugging information, usually used only in development |

## Structured logging

The built-in logging API (using `this._log`) provides structured logging to let you log key-value
pairs instead of raw strings. Structures logs are readable by both machines &
humans to make them easier to parse & search.

Passing an object to a log will print as structured data. For example:

```typescript
this._log.info('increment', { connection: rpc.connection.id, count });
// Prints: level=INFO msg=increment connection=123 count=456
```

The first parameter in each log method is the message. The rest of the arguments are used for structured logging.

## `this._log` vs `console.log` logging

`this._log` makes it easier to manage complex logs, while `console.log` can
become unmaintainable at scale.

Consider this example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript {{ "title": "structured_logging.ts" }}
export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>, count: number): number {
    // Prints: level=INFO msg=increment connection=123 count=456
    this._log.info('increment', { connection: rpc.connection.id, count });

    this._state.count += count;
    return this._state.count;
  }

  // ...etc...
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "unstructured_logging.ts" }}
export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>, count: number): number {
    // Prints: Increment for connection 123 with count 456
    console.log(`Increment for connection ${rpc.connection.id} with count ${count}`);

    this._state.count += count;
    return this._state.count;
  }

  // ...etc...
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If you need to search through a lot of logs, it's easier to read the structured logs. To find increments for a single connection, you can search `connection=123`.

Additionally, structured logs can be parsed and queried at scale using tools like Elasticsearch, Loki, or Datadog. For example, you can parse the log `level=INFO msg=increment connection=123 count=456` in to the JSON object `{"level":"INFO","msg":"increment","connection":123,"count":456}` and then query it as you would any other structured data.

## Configuring logging

The Rivet logging API is powered by the [@std/log](https://jsr.io/@std/log) package.

By default, logs are printed in [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) format for
a balance between machine & human readability. To configure the logging format
yourself, you can call the [`setup`](https://jsr.io/@std/log/doc/~/setup)
function in `_onStart`.
