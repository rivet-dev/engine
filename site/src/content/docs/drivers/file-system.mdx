# File System

The File System driver is the default driver for Rivet Actors, providing local file-based storage for state management and inter-actor communication. If no driver is specified in your configuration, the File System driver will be used automatically.

<Info>
The File System driver is ideal for development and single-node deployments. For production applications that need to scale horizontally across multiple machines, use the [Redis driver](/docs/drivers/redis).

## Feature Support

| Feature | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Horizontal scaling | No |
| WebSockets | Yes |
| SSE | Yes |
| Edge | No |
| Scheduling | Yes |

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install packages">

The File System driver is included with `rivetkit` - no additional packages needed:

```bash
npm install rivetkit
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the driver">

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Default Configuration">

Use the default configuration with automatic path based on your current working directory:

```typescript {{"title":"server.ts"}}
import { createFileSystemDriver } from "rivetkit";
import { registry } from "./registry";

const driver = createFileSystemDriver();
const { serve, client } = registry.runServer({ driver });

// ...rest of your server...
```

The default path is stored in your system's data path. The path is unique to the current working directory, so you can safely run multiple projects on the same machine.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Custom Path">

Specify a custom path for actor storage:

```typescript {{"title":"server.ts"}}
import { createFileSystemDriver } from "rivetkit";
import { registry } from "./registry";

const driver = createFileSystemDriver({
  path: "/custom/path/to/actors"
});
const { serve, client } = registry.runServer({ driver });

// ...rest of your server...
```

**Configuration Options:**

- `path` - Custom directory path for storing actor data (optional)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Data Management

The path where your actors are stored is printed when you start your project. To reset your actors, delete the folder that is printed.

If running on a single node, make sure to back up your actors folder regularly. `rsync` works nicely with this because each actor is stored as its own file.
