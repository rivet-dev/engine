# Full Development Docker Compose

This Docker Compose is intended for running a full development environment for Rivet.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Required ports

The following ports need to be open before running Rivet:

| Service      | Description     | Optional | Port      |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Rivet Server | API             |          | 8080      |
|              | Object Storage  |          | 9000      |
| Rivet Guard  | HTTP            |          | 7080      |
|              | HTTPS           |          | 7443      |
|              | TCP & UDP       | X        | 7500-7599 |
| Rivet Client | Host Networking | X        | 7600-7699 |

## Operation

### Start

Start the cluster with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/dev-full/docker-compose.yml up -d --build --parallel 1
```

This will start the cluster in detached mode. Once complete, visit the dashboard at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To test creating an actor end-to-end, run:

```bash
./scripts/manual_tests/actors_e2e_js.ts
```

You should see an actor in the actor list in the dashboard.

### Stop

To shut down the Rivet cluster, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/dev-full/docker-compose.yml down
```

When you start the cluster again, your data will still be there.

### Nuke from orbit

To destroy all containers & volumes immediately, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/dev-full/docker-compose.yml down -v -t 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Have you tried turning it off and on again?

If something gets _really_ screwed up, you can destroy the entire cluster with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/dev-full/docker-compose.yml down -v -t 0
```

This will destroy all containers & volumes immediately.
