## Quick Deploy

Choose the template that best fits your needs:

| **Rivet Template** | **Rivet Starter** |

| [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet?referralCode=RC7bza&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic) | [![Deploy Rivet Starter](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet-starter) |
| **Blank template** to start fresh | **Complete example** with chat app |
| - Rivet Engine | - Pre-configured Rivet Engine |
| - PostgreSQL database | - Example chat application with Actors |
| - Basic configuration | - PostgreSQL database |
| - Manual setup required | - Rivet Inspector for debugging |
| | - Ready to run immediately |

You can also use the [Rivet Railway template](https://github.com/rivet-gg/template-railway) as a starting point for your application.

<Note>
After deploying either template, you can find the `RIVET__AUTH__ADMIN_TOKEN` under the **Variables** tab in the Railway dashboard. This token is required to access the Rivet Inspector.
