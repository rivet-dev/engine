# Self-Hosting Overview

Rivet consists of several core components that work together to provide a complete actor orchestration platform. The Rivet Engine is the core of self-hosting and is used for orchestrating actors at scale:

## Core Components

- **Your Backend** - Your application server that handles user requests and includes a runner component that executes actor code
- **Rivet Engine** - Main orchestration service that manages actor lifecycle, routes messages, and provides APIs
- **Storage** - Persistence layer for actor state and messaging infrastructure for real-time communication
