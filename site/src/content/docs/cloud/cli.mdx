## Common Commands

### Deploy & Publish

```bash
# Deploy your configuration to development environment
rivet deploy

# Deploy to a specific environment
rivet deploy --environment prod

# Publish a JavaScript actor build
rivet build publish my-build-name ./path/to/script.js

# Publish a Docker image
rivet build publish my-build-name ./Dockerfile
```

### Actor Management

```bash
# List all actors
rivet actor list

# Get details about a specific actor
rivet actor get my-actor-id

# View actor logs
rivet actor logs my-actor-id

# View actor logs (no follow)
rivet actor logs --no-follow my-actor-id

# Destroy an actor
rivet actor destroy my-actor-id
```

### Environment Management

```bash
# List environments
rivet environment list

# Select default environment (interactive)
rivet environment select

# Select default environment
rivet environment select prod

# Open dashboard in browser
rivet environment view
```

## Configuration with Environment Variables

Rivet CLI can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN` - See [tokens documentation](/docs/tokens) on instructions on how to create a cloud token
- `RIVET_ENDPOINT` - Custom API endpoint (for self-hosted or enterprise instances)

## CI/CD Integration

Rivet CLI is designed to work seamlessly in CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
export RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN="your-cloud-token"

# Example: Deploy rivet.json
rivet deploy --environment prod

# Example: deploy a JavaScript script to production
rivet build publish --environment prod my-build ./src/actor.js

# Example: deploy a Dockerfile to production
rivet build publish --environment prod my-build docker://my-image:latest
```

## Advanced Usage

### Shell

Rivet offers a convenient shell utility to simplify token management. The `rivet shell` command automatically generates a token and populates common environment variables for you.

For example:

```bash
# Open an interactive shell with populated environment variables
rivet shell

# Run a specific command with populated environment variables
rivet shell -e 'node my-script.js'

# Example: check environment variables
rivet shell -e 'env | grep RIVET'
```

The Rivet shell automatically populates the following environment variables:

- `RIVET_ENDPOINT` - The API endpoint URL for your Rivet instance
- `RIVET_SERVICE_TOKEN` - Authentication token for accessing Rivet services
- `RIVET_PROJECT` - The current project identifier
- `RIVET_ENVIRONMENT` - The current environment name (e.g., dev, prod)

This is especially helpful for running tests or development tools that interact with Rivet.

<Warning>
	**Shell is experimental.** The command is subject to change.
</Warning>

### Working with Metadata

```bash
# Get information about the current configuration
rivet metadata api-endpoint
rivet metadata access-token
```
