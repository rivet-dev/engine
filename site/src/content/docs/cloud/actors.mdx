# Rivet Actors (Low Level)

Rivet Actors allows you to deploy resilient, stateful services that maintain their state between requests. Use them for websocket servers, game backends, real-time collaboration services, and more.

## What are actors good for?

- **Stateful Services**: Applications where maintaining state across interactions is critical. For example, **Collaborative Apps** with shared editing and automatic persistence.
- **Realtime Systems**: Applications requiring fast, in-memory state modifications or push updates to connected clients. For example, **Multiplayer Games** with game rooms and player state.
- **Long-Running Processes**: Tasks that execute over extended periods or in multiple steps. For example, **AI Agents** with ongoing conversations and stateful tool calls.
- **Durability**: Processes that must survive crashes and restarts without data loss. For example, **Durable Execution** workflows that continue after system restarts.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Systems that need to scale by distributing load across many instances. For example, **Realtime Stream Processing** for stateful event handling.
- **Local-First Architecture**: Systems that synchronize state between offline clients. For example, **Local-First Sync** between devices.

## Quickstart

### Step 1: Writing an actor

Add the `@rivet-gg/actor` package to your project for comprehensive TypeScript definitions:

```sh
npm install -S @rivet-gg/actor
```

<Note>
  **This package is optional.** You can use Rivet actors without this package, but you'll need to define your own types.
</Note>

Every actor must export a default object with an async `start` function. Here's a simple HTTP server example:

```ts {{"file": "src/index.ts"}}
import type { ActorContext } from "@rivet-gg/actor";
import { Hono } from "hono";

export default {
  async start(ctx: ActorContext) {
    const port = parseInt(Deno.env.get("PORT_HTTP") || "8080");
    console.log(`HTTP server running on port ${port}`);
    
    const app = new Hono();
    
    app.get("/", (c) => {
      return c.text(`Hello from Rivet Actor ${ctx.metadata.actor.id} running in ${ctx.metadata.region.id}!`);
    });
    
    Deno.serve({ port }, app.fetch);
    
    // Keep the actor running until explicitly destroyed
    await new Promise((resolve) => {});
  }
};
```

What this code does:
- Creates a simple HTTP server using Hono with Deno
- Sets up a route that returns the actor ID and region information
- Keeps the actor running indefinitely by returning a promise that never resolves

<Tip>
	You can also use a class with a static method for your entrypoint:

	```ts {{"file": "src/index.ts"}}
	import type { ActorContext } from "@rivet-gg/actor";

	export default class MyActor {
	  static async start(ctx: ActorContext) {
		// Your HTTP server implementation would go here
	  }
	}
	```
</Tip>

### Step 2: Deploying an actor

Specify the script in your `rivet.json`:

```json {{ "title": "rivet.json" }}
{
  "actors": {
    "my-actor": {
      "script": "./src/index.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

Now deploy your actor with:

```sh
rivet deploy
```

### Step 3: Starting an actor

In this step, you're requesting Rivet to launch your actor code in the cloud:

```typescript
import { RivetClient } from "@rivet-gg/api";

// Initialize the Rivet client with your API token
// You can get this from the Rivet dashboard
const client = new RivetClient({
  token: process.env.RIVET_TOKEN
});

// Create an actor - this launches your code on Rivet's infrastructure
const { actor } = await client.actors.create({
  // Your project and environment IDs from the Rivet dashboard
  project: "your-project-id",
  environment: "your-environment-id",
  body: {
    // Tags help identify this specific actor instance
    // You can query actors by these tags later
    tags: { name: "my-actor" },
    
    // buildTags determine which actor code to run
    // This should match tags in your rivet.json build configuration
    // The current tag is automatically assigned on deploy
    buildTags: { name: "my-actor", current: "true" },
    
    // Network configuration for your actor
    network: {
      ports: {
        http: {
          // The protocol used for communication
          protocol: "https",
        }
      }
    },
    
    // Optional: Specify a region for lower latency to specific users
    // If not specified, Rivet will choose the optimal region
    // region: "atl",
  }
});

// The actor.id is a unique identifier for this actor instance
console.log("Created actor:", actor.id);
```

What happens during creation:
- Rivet finds the latest build matching your `buildTags`
- It provisions resources in the specified region (or chooses the best one)
- It starts your actor code with the provided environment variables
- The actor starts running and initializes based on your code's `start` function

See [actors.create](/docs/api/actors/create) for more options.

### Step 4: Connecting to an actor

Once your actor is running, you can access its URL directly from the actor object:

```typescript
// The actor response includes the URL information
// You can access it for any port you configured
const httpUrl = actor.network.ports.http.url;

// The URL is a public endpoint to your actor
console.log("Actor HTTP URL:", httpUrl);

// Use the URL to communicate with your actor
// In this example, we're calling the /hello endpoint on our HTTP server
const response = await fetch(`${httpUrl}/hello`);
const text = await response.text();
console.log("Response from actor:", text);
```

What happens during connection:
- Each port configured for your actor gets a unique URL
- These URLs are accessible based on your actor's security settings
- The URL routes to your actor regardless of which region it's in
- For additional security, you can use `getConnection` to generate temporary, authenticated URLs

See [actors.get](/docs/api/actors/get) for more details.

### Step 5: Destroying an actor

When you're finished using the actor, it's important to destroy it to free up resources:

```typescript
// Destroy the actor to free up resources and stop billing
await client.actors.destroy(actor.id, {
  project: "your-project-id",
  environment: "your-environment-id",
});

console.log("Actor destroyed");
```

What happens during destruction:
- Rivet sends a termination signal to your actor
- Your actor gets a short grace period to clean up resources
- All compute resources associated with the actor are freed
- You stop being billed for the actor's runtime

See [actors.destroy](/docs/api/actors/destroy) for more details.

<Note>
  Always destroy actors when you're done with them to avoid unnecessary costs.
  Actors will continue running and billing will continue until explicitly destroyed.
</Note>

## Configuration

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/config) for all available options.

## The `ActorContext` Object

Your `start` function receives an `ActorContext` object with important metadata and services:

```ts
interface ActorContext {
  // Information about your actor and its environment
  metadata: {
    actor: {
      id: string;
      tags: Record<string, string>;
      createdAt: Date;
    };
    project: {
      id: string;
      slug: string;
    };
    environment: {
      id: string;
      slug: string;
    };
    cluster: {
      id: string;
    };
    region: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
    };
    build: {
      id: string;
    };
  };
  // Key-value storage API
  kv: {
    // KV methods (see documentation for details)
  };
}
```
