# Networking

Rivet provides a simple yet powerful networking system for your actors. When you create an actor, you define the ports it will use, and Rivet handles the networking infrastructure, including URL generation, port mapping, and traffic routing.

## Configuring Networking

When creating an actor, you specify the ports that your application needs to expose. This is done through the `network.ports` parameter when creating your actor with the [actor.create](/docs/api/actors/create) API:

```javascript
// Simple example defining an HTTP port
const actor = await rivet.actors.create({
  // ...other configuration
  network: {
    ports: {
      http: { protocol: "https" }
    }
  }
});
```

Once your actor is running with properly configured ports, you can access it through the URLs provided by Rivet. These URLs are available:

- Via the API in the actor creation response under `actor.network.ports.http.url`
- In the Rivet Hub dashboard for your actor

## Listening For Requests On The Actor

Once your actor is running, Rivet injects environment variables containing information about the assigned ports. Your application should use these variables to determine what port to listen on.

For example:

```javascript
// Simple example starting an HTTP server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT_HTTP;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Environment Variable Naming

For each port defined in your actor configuration under `network.ports`, Rivet sets a single environment variable `PORT_{NAME}` where `{NAME}` is the uppercase version of the key you used in the `network.ports` object.

Your application should read these environment variables to know which ports to bind to.

For example:

- `network.ports.http` becomes the `PORT_HTTP` environment variable
- `network.ports.game` becomes the `PORT_GAME` environment variable
- `network.ports["hello-world"]` becomes the `PORT_HELLO_WORLD` environment variable

## Examples

Here are complete examples demonstrating how to set up networking for both the client and server.

### HTTP Server Example

#### Client (Creating the Actor)

```javascript
// Creating an actor with an HTTP port
const actor = await rivet.actors.create({
  tags: { name: "my-http-server" },
  buildTags: { name: "my-http-server", current: "true" },
  network: {
    ports: {
      // "http" is the port name (becomes PORT_HTTP env var)
      http: { protocol: "https" }
    }
  },
});

console.log(actor.network.ports.http); // Information about HTTP port
console.log(actor.network.ports.http.url); // URL to connect to
```

#### Actor (Starting the Server)

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Get the port from the environment variable
const port = process.env.PORT_HTTP;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Rivet!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### TCP Game Server Example

_TCP is only available on enterprise & self-hosted._

#### Client (Creating the Actor)

```javascript
// Creating an actor with a TCP port for a game server
const actor = await rivet.actors.create({
  tags: { name: "my-game-server" },
  buildTags: { name: "my-game-server", current: "true" },
  network: {
    ports: {
      // "game" is the port name (becomes PORT_GAME env var)
      game: { protocol: "tcp" }
    }
  },
});

let port = actor.network.ports.game;
console.log(`${port.hostname}:${port.port}`); // Connection address for port
```

#### Server (Starting the Server)

```javascript
const net = require('net');

// Get the port from the environment variable
// This corresponds to the "game" key in the network.ports object
const port = process.env.PORT_GAME;

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.write('Hello from Rivet Game Server!\r\n');
});

server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`TCP game server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Supported Protocols

Rivet supports the following protocols for actor ports:

| Protocol | Description | Recommendation | Enterprise & Self-Hosted Only |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | --- |
| `https` | HTTPS and secure WebSocket traffic | Recommended for web applications | --- |
| `http` | Insecure HTTP or WebSocket traffic | Not recommended (use https instead) | --- |
| `tcp_tls` | Secure TCP sockets | Recommended for TCP connections | --- |
| `tcp` | TCP sockets | Not recommended (use tcp_tls instead) | X |
| `udp` | UDP sockets | Use for real-time applications requiring UDP | X |


## SSL and TLS

When you use the `https` or `tcp_tls` protocols, Rivet automatically handles all SSL/TLS encryption for you.

Your server should listen for regular unencrypted HTTP or TCP traffic on the assigned port.

## Troubleshooting

### Bad Gateway (502)

If you receive a "Bad Gateway" (502) error when accessing your actor, it typically means:

- Your actor is listening on the wrong port (check the environment variables)
- Your actor has crashed during request handling

**Resolution:** Check the actor logs in the Rivet Hub dashboard to see if your server started correctly. Verify that your application is listening on the port specified by the `PORT_{NAME}` environment variable, not a hardcoded port.

### Not Found (404)

A "Not Found" (404) error usually indicates:

- Your actor has crashed before receiving the request
- The URL you're using is incorrect
- There's a bug in your application's routing

**Resolution:** Manually validate the URL shown for the actor in the Rivet Hub dashboard. Check the actor logs to ensure your application started successfully and is handling requests properly.
