# Rivet Containers

Rivet Containers allows you to deploy any application packaged as a Docker container to the cloud. Deploy web servers, game backends, or any custom service with complete control over your runtime environment.

<EnterpriseCloud />

## What are containers good for?

- **High-Memory Workloads**: Applications requiring substantial RAM for processing large data. For example, **PDF Processing** with document parsing and transformation.
- **CPU-Heavy Workloads**: Tasks demanding significant computational resources. For example, **Media Transcoding** with FFmpeg for video conversion.
- **Browser Automation**: Headless browsers for testing, scraping, or rendering. For example, **Web Scraping** with Puppeteer or Playwright.
- **Sandboxed Code Execution**: Safely running untrusted code in isolated environments. For example, **MMOs** or **First-Person Shooters**.
- **Headless Game Servers**: Game backends without rendering requirements. For example, **Turn-Based Game Logic** for chess or card games.
- **Custom Dependencies**: Applications requiring specific system libraries or tools. For example, **Computer Vision Processing** with OpenCV dependencies.

## Quickstart

### Step 1: Writing a Dockerfile

Create a simple HTTP server in your project:

```javascript {{"file": "server.js"}}
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end("Hello from Rivet Container!");
});

const port = process.env.PORT_HTTP;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

Create a Dockerfile in your project directory:

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Dockerfile" }}
FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Create rivet user and set proper permissions
RUN addgroup -S rivet && \
    adduser -S -G rivet rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER rivet

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

<Note>
	We'll pass the ports & env vars used in the Dockerfile in _Step 3_. Read more in the API docs for [actors.create](/docs/api/actors/create).
</Note>

### Step 2: Deploying a container

Specify the Dockerfile in your `rivet.json`:

```json {{ "title": "rivet.json" }}
{
  "containers": {
    "my-container": {
      "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    }
  }
}
```

Now deploy your container with:

```sh
rivet deploy
```

### Step 3: Starting a container

In this step, you're requesting Rivet to launch your containerized application in the cloud:

```typescript
import { RivetClient } from "@rivet-gg/api";

// Initialize the Rivet client with your API token
// You can get this from the Rivet dashboard
const client = new RivetClient({
  token: process.env.RIVET_TOKEN
});

// Create a container - this launches your container on Rivet's infrastructure
const { actor } = await client.actors.create({
  // Your project and environment IDs from the Rivet dashboard
  project: "your-project-id",
  environment: "your-environment-id",
  body: {
    // Tags help identify this specific container instance
    // You can query containers by these tags later
    tags: { name: "my-container" },
    
    // buildTags determine which container code to run
    // This should match tags in your rivet.json build configuration
    // The current tag is automatically assigned on deploy
    buildTags: { name: "my-container", current: "true" },
    
    // Network configuration for your container
    network: {
      ports: {
        http: {
          // The protocol used for communication
          protocol: "https",
        }
      }
    },
    
    // Optional: Specify a region for lower latency to specific users
    // If not specified, Rivet will choose the optimal region
    // region: "atl",
    
    // Container resources specification
    resources: {
      cpu: 1000,       // Number of CPU thousanths of a core
      memory: 1024,    // Memory in MB
    }
  }
});

// The actor.id is a unique identifier for this container instance
console.log("Created container:", actor.id);
```

<Note>
  While this feature is called "Containers" in the UI and documentation, the underlying API uses the term "actors" (e.g., `client.actors.create`). This is because there is a lot of overlap between the actor & container APIs.
</Note>


What happens during creation:
- Rivet finds the latest build matching your `buildTags`
- It provisions resources in the specified region (or chooses the best one)
- It starts your container with the provided environment variables
- The container starts running based on your Dockerfile's CMD or ENTRYPOINT

See [actors.create](/docs/api/actors/create) for more options.

### Step 4: Connecting to a container

Once your container is running, you can access its URL directly from the container object:

```typescript
// The actor response includes the URL information
// You can access it for any port you configured
const httpUrl = actor.network.ports.http.url;

// The URL is a public endpoint to your container
console.log("Container HTTP URL:", httpUrl);

// Use the URL to communicate with your container
// In this example, we're calling our HTTP server
const response = await fetch(httpUrl);
const text = await response.text();
console.log("Response from container:", text);
```

What happens during connection:
- Each port configured for your container gets a unique URL
- These URLs are accessible based on your container's security settings
- The URL routes to your container regardless of which region it's in
- For additional security, you can use `getConnection` to generate temporary, authenticated URLs

See [actors.get](/docs/api/actors/get) for more details.

### Step 5: Destroying a container

When you're finished using the container, it's important to destroy it to free up resources:

```typescript
// Destroy the container to free up resources and stop billing
await client.actors.destroy(actor.id, {
  project: "your-project-id",
  environment: "your-environment-id",
});

console.log("Container destroyed");
```

What happens during destruction:
- Rivet sends a termination signal to your container
- Your container gets a short grace period to clean up resources
- All compute resources associated with the container are freed
- You stop being billed for the container's runtime

See [actors.destroy](/docs/api/actors/destroy) for more details.

<Note>
  Always destroy containers when you're done with them to avoid unnecessary costs.
  Containers will continue running and billing will continue until explicitly destroyed.
</Note>

## Configuration Options

When configuring your Docker-based build in `rivet.json`, you have access to the following options under `builds`:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `dockerfile` | Path to the Dockerfile relative to your project | `"Dockerfile"`, `"docker/prod.Dockerfile"` |
| `image` | Use an existing image instead of building | `"node:22-alpine"` |
| `build_path` | Directory containing your build context | `"."`, `"./backend"` |
| `build_target` | Target stage in multi-stage builds | `"production"`, `"development"` |
| `build_args` | Key-value pairs passed as build arguments | `{ "NODE_ENV": "production" }` |

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/config) for all available options.

## Non-Root User Requirement

For security reasons, Rivet containers **cannot run as root**. You must explicitly set a non-root user in your Dockerfile.

Different base images require different commands to create non-root users:

<CodeGroup>

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Alpine Linux" }}
RUN addgroup -S rivet && \
    adduser -S -G rivet rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Ubuntu/Debian" }}
RUN groupadd -r rivet && \
    useradd --no-log-init -r -g rivet rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "RHEL/CentOS/Fedora" }}
RUN groupadd -r rivet && \
    useradd -r -g rivet -s /sbin/nologin rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Arch Linux" }}
RUN groupadd rivet && \
    useradd -m -g rivet -s /bin/bash rivet && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet
```

</CodeGroup>

## Runtime Details

### Memory & CPU Overcommit

Understanding Rivet's memory and CPU resource allocation helps you optimize performance and avoid unexpected container termination.

<Note>
  Monitor your container's resource usage through the Rivet dashboard to ensure you stay within your allocated limits and avoid performance issues or unexpected termination.
</Note>

### Memory Limits

Rivet uses a two-tier memory allocation system:

- **Soft limit**: This is the memory amount you've reserved on the host machine for your container. This is the target amount you should stay under during normal operation.
- **Hard limit**: This is set 50% higher than your reserved amount to provide a buffer for unexpected memory spikes. For example, if you reserved 1 GB, your hard limit would be approximately 1.5 GB. Exceeding this hard limit will likely cause your container to be killed.

#### CPU Throttling

CPU allocation works similarly to memory:

- The CPU percentage you see in monitoring represents what you should follow to avoid getting throttled during periods of resource contention on the host.
- Like memory, the CPU has a mechanism that allows for temporary spikes above your allocated amount, but sustained high usage may result in throttling if there's resource contention.
