# Rivet Functions

Rivet Functions allows you to deploy serverless functions that can handle HTTP requests. You can write your functions and package them in containers.

<EnterpriseCloud />

## What are functions good for?

- **API Endpoints**: Building lightweight, scalable REST or GraphQL APIs. For example, **CRUD Operations** for your application's data layer.
- **Webhook Handlers**: Processing events from third-party services. For example, **Payment Processing** with Stripe or PayPal integration.
- **Authentication Services**: Managing user identity and access control. For example, **OAuth Flows** or custom authentication systems.

## Quickstart

### 1. Set up your project

Let's create a simple Node.js HTTP server project:

```bash
# Create project
mkdir my-rivet-function
cd my-rivet-function

# Setup NPM
npm init -y
npm install hono@4 @hono/node-server@1
```


Add the following files to your project: 

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ "title": "index.js" }}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";

const app = new Hono();
const port = process.env.PORT_HTTP || 8080;

app.get("/", (c) => {
	return c.text("Hello from Rivet Functions!");
});

console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
serve({
	fetch: app.fetch,
	port,
});
```

```json {{ "title": "rivet.json" }}
{
  "functions": {
    "hello-world": {
      "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    }
  }
}
```

```dockerfile {{ "title": "Dockerfile" }}
FROM node:22-alpine

RUN addgroup -S rivet && adduser -S rivet -G rivet

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

RUN chown -R rivet:rivet /app
USER rivet

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
	**Configuring port**: By default, Rivet Functions will listen on port 8080. This can be configured using the `networking.internal_port` option in your configuration (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) below).
</Info>

See [Rivet Containers documentation](/docs/containers) for more information on writing code for the Rivet platform.

### 2. Deploy your function

```bash
rivet deploy
```

You will be prompted to configure a route on the first run. You can use the recommended route or configure it later in the dashboard under the _Functions_ tab.

### 3. Test your function

Visit your function at the configured URL. You can monitor the logs in the _Logs_ tab of the Rivet Dashboard.

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `path` | The URL path to route requests to (cannot end with `/`) |
| `route_subpaths` | When true, routes requests to this path and all nested subpaths to this function |
| `strip_prefix` | When true, removes the configured path prefix from the request URL before forwarding to your function |
| `resources.cpu` | CPU allocation for the function (defaults to 1) |
| `resources.memory` | Memory allocation in MB (defaults to 1024) |
| `networking.internal_port` | The port your function listens on within the container (defaults to 8080) |

#### Example: route_subpaths

When `route_subpaths` is `true`:
- Function with path `/api` will handle requests to `/api`, `/api/users`, `/api/products`, and any other path starting with `/api`

When `route_subpaths` is `false`:
- Function with path `/api` will only handle requests to the exact path `/api` and nothing else

#### Example: strip_prefix

When `strip_prefix` is `true`:
- Request to `/api/users` will be forwarded to your function as just `/users` (the `/api` prefix is removed)

When `strip_prefix` is `false`:
- Request to `/api/users` will be forwarded to your function with the full path `/api/users` intact

See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/config) for the complete configuration options.

When you make changes to your routes, the `rivet deploy` command will prompt you before applying these changes to how your requests get routed.

## Routes (Advanced)

Routes configure how incoming HTTP traffic gets directed to the specific function workers that handle requests. They define the mapping between public URLs and your deployed functions. Routes can be manually configured in the Functions tab of the Rivet Dashboard.

### Hostnames

Each route has a unique hostname (URL), and these hostnames cannot be shared across multiple environments.

### Path Matching

Routing priority is determined by path length with longest paths matching first. You can layer multiple paths to create sophisticated routing patterns.

### Programmatic Creation

Routes can be created programmatically via the Rivet API with [`routes.update`](/docs/api/routes/update).
