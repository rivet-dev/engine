# TypeScript Quick Start Guide

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up a TypeScript actor project powered by the <a href="https://actorcore.org" target="_blank">ActorCore framework</a>, deploy it to Rivet, and connect to it from a client.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and explore your project">
    Use the command below to create a new actor project:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```sh {{ "title": "npx" }}
    npx create-actor@latest -p rivet -t counter
    ```

    ```sh {{ "title": "npm" }}
    npm create actor@latest -p rivet -t counter
    ```

    ```sh {{ "title": "pnpm" }}
    pnpm create actor@latest -p rivet -t counter
    ```

    ```sh {{ "title": "yarn" }}
    yarn create actor@latest -p rivet -t counter
    ```

    ```sh {{ "title": "bun" }}
    bun create actor@latest -p rivet -t counter
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    During setup, you'll be prompted to specify a project directory.

    Once setup completes, you'll have a project with:

    - `actor.config.ts`: Actor configuration 
    - `src/index.ts`: Main actor implementation
    - `tests/client.ts`: Client test script
    
    The counter template provides a simple actor that maintains a numeric state and exposes methods to increment it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Rivet">
    Deploy your actor with:

    ```sh
    cd your-project
    npm run deploy
    ```

    You'll be guided through:
    1. Logging in to your Rivet account (or creating one)
    2. Creating a new project (if needed)
    3. Selecting an environment 

    After deployment completes, you'll receive:
    - **Actor Manager URL**: Your endpoint for client connections
    - Links to the Rivet Hub for monitoring and management
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to your actor">
    Update the `tests/client.ts` file with your deployment URL:

    ```typescript
    // Replace with your Actor Manager URL from the deployment output
    const client = new Client("https://your-actor-manager-url.rivet.run:443");
    ```

    Run the test client:

    ```sh
    npx tsx tests/client.ts
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```text
    Event: 1
    RPC: 1
    ```

    Run it again to see the actor state increment as it persists between calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor your deployment">
    Visit the [Rivet Hub](https://hub.rivet.gg) to:
    
    - Monitor your actors in real-time
    - Check logs and debug issues
