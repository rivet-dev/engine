# BetterStack Monitoring

[BetterStack](https://betterstack.com/) provides comprehensive monitoring, logging, and uptime tracking for your applications. This guide will show you how to integrate BetterStack with your Rivet Actor to monitor performance and collect logs.

<Image src={betterStackExample} />

<Warning>
	This guide only applies to Docker Actors.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A [BetterStack](https://betterstack.com/) account
- Your BetterStack API token
- The Rivet CLI installed
- Docker installed (for local testing)

## How It Works

The integration uses [Vector](https://vector.dev/) as a log collector and metrics shipper. Logs from your actor are piped to Vector, then forwarded to BetterStack. Vector also automatically collects system metrics to upload to BetterStack.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a BetterStack Account

If you don't already have one, sign up for a BetterStack account at [betterstack.com](https://betterstack.com/).

### 2. Get Your BetterStack Credentials

From your BetterStack dashboard:

1. Navigate to the Logs section
2. Create a new source by clicking _Connect source_
3. Select _Logs + Metrics > Vector_ then click _Connect source_
4. Note _Ingesting host_ and _Source token_ for later

### 3. Configure Your Project

#### Vector Configuration

Create a `vector.yaml` file in your project with the following configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  # Capture stdout/stderr from the child process
  server_logs:
    type: "stdin"

  # Collect host metrics
  host_metrics:
    type: "host_metrics"
    scrape_interval_secs: 30
    collectors: [cpu, load, host, memory, network]

transforms:
  # Add lobby ID to logs
  add_lobby_id:
    type: "remap"
    inputs: ["server_logs"]
    source: |
      .lobby_id = "${LOBBY_ID:unknown}"

  # Add lobby ID to metrics
  add_lobby_id_metrics:
    type: "remap"
    inputs: ["host_metrics"]
    source: |
      .lobby_id = "${LOBBY_ID:unknown}"

sinks:
  # Ship logs to BetterStack
  logs_sink:
    type: "http"
    method: "post"
    uri: "https://${BETTERSTACK_HOST}/"
    encoding:
      codec: "json"
    compression: "gzip"
    auth:
      strategy: "bearer"
      token: "${BETTERSTACK_TOKEN}"
    inputs: ["add_lobby_id"]
    request:
      retry_attempts: 5
      retry_initial_backoff_secs: 1
      retry_max_duration_secs: 10

  # Ship metrics to BetterStack
  metrics_sink:
    type: "http"
    method: "post"
    uri: "https://${BETTERSTACK_HOST}/metrics"
    encoding:
      codec: "json"
    compression: "gzip"
    auth:
      strategy: "bearer"
      token: "${BETTERSTACK_TOKEN}"
    inputs: ["add_lobby_id_metrics"]
    request:
      retry_attempts: 5
      retry_initial_backoff_secs: 1
      retry_max_duration_secs: 10

  # Print to console for debugging (optional)
  console:
    type: "console"
    inputs: ["add_lobby_id"]
    encoding:
      codec: "text"
```

<Tip>
	`lobby_id` is being used as an example to uniquely identify your actor. You can define your own custom identifier.
</Tip>

#### Dockerfile Configuration

Update your Dockerfile to include the Vector config & Vector binary.

Here is an example Dockerfile for a Node.js Actor:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# check=skip=SecretsUsedInArgOrEnv

FROM node:22-bookworm-slim

ENV CI=true
ENV COREPACK_ENABLE_STRICT=0
ENV VECTOR_LOG=ERROR
RUN corepack enable

# Install Vector
RUN apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://setup.vector.dev)" && \
    apt-get install -y vector

# Configure Vector with BetterStack
COPY ./vector.yaml /etc/vector/vector.yaml

# Setup app
RUN groupadd -r rivet && useradd -r -g rivet rivet && \
    mkdir -p /home/rivet/.cache/node/corepack && \
    chown -R rivet:rivet /home/rivet
WORKDIR /app
COPY --chown=rivet:rivet . .
USER rivet
RUN yarn install

# Pipe logs to Vector
CMD ["sh", "-c", "NODE_ENV=production node ./server.js 2>&1 | vector"]
```

#### Rivet Configuration

If you don't already have a `rivet.json`, you can use this:

```json
{
  "builds": {
    "example": {
      "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
      "access": "private"
    }
  },
  "unstable": {
    "manager": {
      "enable": false
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Deploy Your Actor

Deploy your Actor to Rivet:

```bash
rivet deploy
```

### 5. Pass BetterStack Credentials to Your Actor

When creating Actors, pass your BetterStack credentials as environment variables:

```javascript
await client.actor.create({
    project: PROJECT_ID,
    environment: ENVIRONMENT_ID,
    body: {
        // ... other configuration ...
        runtime: {
            environment: {
                LOBBY_ID: lobbyId,
                BETTERSTACK_TOKEN: "your-betterstack-token",  // Copy from dashboard
                BETTERSTACK_HOST: "logs.betterstack.com"  // Copy from dashboard
            }
        },
        // ... other configuration ...
    },
});
```

## Viewing Logs and Metrics

Once your Actor is running with the BetterStack integration:

1. Log in to your BetterStack dashboard
2. Navigate to the Logs section to view your application logs
3. Check the Metrics section to view performance data
4. Set up alerts based on log patterns or metric thresholds

## Creating Custom Dashboards

You can create custom dashboards to monitor your Actors by lobby ID:

1. In your BetterStack dashboard, navigate to Dashboards
2. Click _Create dashboard_
3. Click _Create chart_
4. Change the query type to _SQL expression_
5. Write a custom SQL query using the lobby_id tag in the `GROUP BY` (see examples below)
6. Save and configure your dashboard

### Example: CPU Usage by Lobby ID

Here's an example SQL query to chart CPU usage by lobby ID:

```sql
 -- CPU Usage by Lobby ID
 SELECT
   {{time}} AS time,
   metricTag('lobby_id') AS series,
   -- Calculate rate of CPU seconds consumption per second
   avgMerge(rate_avg) AS "CPU Usage (cores)"
 FROM {{source}}
 WHERE
   name = 'cpu_seconds_total'
   AND time BETWEEN {{start_time}} AND {{end_time}}
 GROUP BY time, series, series_id
 ORDER BY time, series
```
### Example: Memory Usage by Lobby ID

Here's an example SQL query to chart memory usage by lobby ID:

```sql
-- Memory usage comparison between lobbies
WITH memory_data AS (
  SELECT
    {{time}} AS time,
    metricTag('lobby_id') AS lobby_id,
    avgMerge(value_avg) AS memory_bytes
  FROM {{source}}
  WHERE 
    name = 'memory_total_bytes'
    AND time BETWEEN {{start_time}} AND {{end_time}}
  GROUP BY time, lobby_id, series_id
),
-- Calculate total memory across all lobbies for each time period
total_per_time AS (
  SELECT
    time,
    SUM(memory_bytes) AS total_memory
  FROM memory_data
  GROUP BY time
)
SELECT
  m.time,
  m.lobby_id AS series,
  -- Show each lobby's percentage of total memory usage
  (m.memory_bytes / t.total_memory) * 100 AS "% of Total Memory"
FROM memory_data m
JOIN total_per_time t ON m.time = t.time
ORDER BY m.time, series
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing logs or metrics in BetterStack:

1. Verify your BetterStack token and host are correct
2. Check that Vector is running properly by examining the Actor logs
3. Ensure your application is writing to stdout/stderr
4. Verify network connectivity from your Actor to BetterStack
