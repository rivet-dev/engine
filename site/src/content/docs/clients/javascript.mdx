# Node.js & Bun

The Rivet JavaScript client allows you to connect to and interact with actors from browser and Node.js applications.

## Basic Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">
Install the RivetKit package:
<InstallPackage name="@rivetkit/actor" />
</Step>

<Step title="Create Client and Connect to Actor">

<Note>
  Make sure you have a running Rivet actor server to connect to. You can follow the [Node.js & Bun Quickstart](https://rivet.gg/docs/actors/quickstart/backend/) to set up a simple actor server.
</Note>

Create client and connect to actors and listen for real-time updates:

```tsx {{"title":"index.ts"}}
import { createClient } from "@rivetkit/actor/client";
import type { Registry } from "../src/registry";

async function main() {
	const client = createClient<Registry>(
		process.env.ENDPOINT ?? "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
	);

	const counter = await client.counter.getOrCreate().connect();

	counter.on("countChanged", (count: number) => console.log("Count changed:", count));

	for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		const out = await counter.increment(1);
		console.log("Increment:", out);

		await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
	}

	await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));
	await counter.dispose();
}

main();

```
</Step>
</Steps>

## API Reference

Follows the same [API as the Node.js client](http://rivet.gg/docs/actors/clients/#actor-client), allowing you to use the same methods and properties for interacting with actors.
