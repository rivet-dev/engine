# Initial Setup

This guide will walk you through creating, deploying, and connecting to a simple Rivet Actor.

Read [_Introduction to Rivet_](/docs/introduction) for an overview of the tool, or read [_What are Actors?_](/docs/actors) for more information on building actors.

## Initialize Project

Create a new project:

```sh
rivet init
```

Follow the instructions to setup your project.

This will create a few files:

| File              | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rivet.json[c]`   | This configures how your app is deployed to Rivet.                                                |
| `deno.json[c]`    | This defines the packages that your project depends on.                                           |
| `counter.ts`      | This is a simple example actor that counts over [RPC](/docs/rpc). This will be deployed in the next step. |
| `counter_test.ts` | This will be used to test the actor was deployed successfully in the next step. This file can be safely deleted if you would like. |

## Deploy project

Deploy your project to Rivet with:

```sh
rivet deploy
```

<Note>If [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting), this will prompt you to input a custom API address.</Note>

### Test actor

To test the actor can be created & connected to, run:

```sh
rivet deno run -A counter_test.ts
```

You can visit the [Rivet Hub](https://hub.rivet.gg) to see the actor you created.

## Setup your editor/IDE (optional)

Rivet actors run on the [Deno](https://deno.com/) runtime. Read their guide on how to configure your IDE [here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/#using-an-editoride).

## Next steps: setup client to connect to actor

Now that you have an actor deployed, you can integrate the Rivet client in to your application.

Follow the appropriate guide for your language:
