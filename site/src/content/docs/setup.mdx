# Initial Setup

This guide will walk you through:

1. Initializing a new project
2. Deploying a Rivet Actor
3. Setting up the Rivet client SDK

If you get stuck at any point, you can read the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/troubleshooting), ask a
question on [Discord](https://rivet.gg/discord)/[GitHub
Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/rivet-gg/discussions), or file a bug report on [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/issues).

<Steps>

<Step title="Install CLI">

The easiest way to get start with Rivet is to use the CLI. Run this command to install Rivet on your system:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="macOS & Linux & WSL">

```sh
curl -fsSL https://releases.rivet.gg/rivet/latest/install.sh | sh
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows (cmd)">

```ps1
powershell -Command "iwr https://releases.rivet.gg/rivet/latest/install.ps1 -useb | iex"
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">

```ps1
iwr https://releases.rivet.gg/rivet/latest/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Build from source">

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet
cargo build --bin rivet
```

The executable will be available at _target/debug/rivet_.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize project & login to Rivet">

Once you've installed the Rivet CLI, run this command in your project root to create a new project:

```sh
rivet init
```

Follow the instructions to initialize your project & login to Rivet.

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy project">

After initializing your project, now you will deploy your actor to Rivet's servers.

Run the following command, and replace `my-app` with the name of your project:

```sh
cd my-app
rivet deploy
```

_If [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting), this will prompt you to input a custom API address._

Once complete, visit the [Rivet Hub](https://hub.rivet.gg) to see the build you uploaded:

<Image src={imgBuilds} alt="Build list" />

</Step>

<Step title="Create a test actor">

Now that you've uploaded a build to Rivet, we need to create an actor using that build.

To test the actor can be created & connected to, run:

```sh
rivet deno run -A counter_test.ts
```

Once complete, visit the [Rivet Hub](https://hub.rivet.gg) to see the actor you created:

<Image src={imgActors} alt="Actor list" />

</Step>

<Step title="Setup client SDK">

Now that you have an actor deployed, integrate the Rivet client SDK with your actor.

Install the package for your language:

- <a href="https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor-client" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
- <a href="https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor-client" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>

Once installed, we need to find the endpoint that your actors connect to. Run this command in your project:

```sh
rivet manager endpoint
```

Use this code to create & connect to the actor. Replace `/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */` with the value from the previous step.

```typescript
import Client from '@rivet-gg/actor-client';
const client = new Client(/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */);

const counter = await client.get({ name: 'counter' }); // Get or create a `counter` actor
const newCount = await counter.increment(5); // Call the method `increment` on the `counter` actor
console.log('New count', newCount);
```

Visit the [Rivet Hub](https://hub.rivet.gg) to see the actor you created.

</Step>

<Step title="Setup your editor/IDE (optional)">

Rivet actors run on the [Deno](https://deno.com/) runtime. Read their guide on how to configure your IDE [here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/#using-an-editoride).
