# AI Agents

## Challenges of Building AI Agents

Common tools: LangChain, OpenAI SDK, custom state management systems, Redis for memory storage

Main pain points:
- Managing conversation history and agent memory across sessions requires external databases
- Keeping context and state synchronized while handling multiple concurrent conversations
- High latency from database round trips to fetch conversation history
- Complex infrastructure for realtime streaming responses to users
- Handling tool calls and maintaining agent state during long-running operations

## How Rivet Solves This

Rivet makes building stateful AI agents simple by providing durable actors that keep conversation history and agent state in memory without external databases.

**Persistent Memory**: Each agent actor maintains its own state including conversation history, tool results, and context. State survives restarts and deployments automatically.

```typescript
const aiAgent = actor({
  state: {
    messages: [] as Array<{role: string, content: string}>,
    context: {}
  },

  actions: {
    chat: async (c, userMessage: string) => {
      c.state.messages.push({ role: "user", content: userMessage });

      const response = await callLLM(c.state.messages);
      c.state.messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: response });

      c.broadcast("message", { role: "assistant", content: response });
      return response;
    }
  }
});
```

**Realtime Streaming**: Use WebSocket connections to stream LLM responses in realtime without additional infrastructure. Learn more about [events](/docs/actors/events).

**Tool Integration**: Execute tool calls within the actor context while maintaining state consistency. See [actions](/docs/actors/actions) for more details.

**No Cold Starts**: Agents hibernate when idle and wake instantly when needed, keeping conversation context ready without paying for idle time. Read about [actor lifecycle](/docs/actors/lifecycle).
