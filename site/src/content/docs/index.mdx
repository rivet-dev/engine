# Welcome to Rivet

Actors combine compute and storage into unified entities for simplified architecture. Actors seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure or can serve as a complete standalone solution.

Whether you're building collaborative applications, multiplayer games, AI agents, or realtime systems, Rivet provides the tools and infrastructure to make your development process smooth and efficient.

## What are actors good for?

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Stateful Services" icon="database" href="#">
    Applications where maintaining state across interactions is critical. For example, **Collaborative Apps** with shared editing and automatic persistence.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Realtime Systems" icon="bolt" href="#">
    Applications requiring fast, in-memory state modifications or push updates to connected clients. For example, **Multiplayer Games** with game rooms and player state.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-Running Processes" icon="clock" href="#">
    Tasks that execute over extended periods or in multiple steps. For example, **AI Agents** with ongoing conversations and stateful tool calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Durability" icon="shield" href="#">
    Processes that must survive crashes and restarts without data loss. For example, **Durable Execution** workflows that continue after system restarts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Horizontal Scalability" icon="arrows-left-right" href="#">
    Systems that need to scale by distributing load across many instances. For example, **Realtime Stream Processing** for stateful event handling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local-First Architecture" icon="devices" href="#">
    Systems that synchronize state between offline clients. For example, **Local-First Sync** between devices.
