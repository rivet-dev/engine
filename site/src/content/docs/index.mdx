# Overview

Rivet is a library for long-lived processes with durable state, realtime, and scalability. It is easily self-hostable and works with your infrastructure.

## Features

- **Stateful Workloads**: Keep memory between operations & run complex logic that requires stateful processes
- **Realtime**: Powered by WebSockets or SSE without the complexity
- **Elastic Scalability**: Scale from zero to millions without cold starts
- **Multi-Region Durable Storage**: Keep state & operations near your users or comply with data soveirgnty
