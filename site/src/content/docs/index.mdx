# Welcome to Rivet

Actors combine compute and storage into unified entities for simplified architecture. Actors seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure or can serve as a complete standalone solution.

Whether you're building collaborative applications, multiplayer games, AI agents, or realtime systems, Rivet provides the tools and infrastructure to make your development process smooth and efficient.

<Tip title="Get Started Faster With ActorCore">
  For getting started quickly using JavaScript, we recommend trying [ActorCore](https://actorcore.org) â€“ our full-stack framework for working with Rivet Actors.

## What are actors good for?

- **Stateful Services**: Applications where maintaining state across interactions is critical. For example, **Collaborative Apps** with shared editing and automatic persistence.
- **Realtime Systems**: Applications requiring fast, in-memory state modifications or push updates to connected clients. For example, **Multiplayer Games** with game rooms and player state.
- **Long-Running Processes**: Tasks that execute over extended periods or in multiple steps. For example, **AI Agents** with ongoing conversations and stateful tool calls.
- **Durability**: Processes that must survive crashes and restarts without data loss. For example, **Durable Execution** workflows that continue after system restarts.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Systems that need to scale by distributing load across many instances. For example, **Realtime Stream Processing** for stateful event handling.
- **Local-First Architecture**: Systems that synchronize state between offline clients. For example, **Local-First Sync** between devices.
