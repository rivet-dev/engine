# Billing

Deploy your application using the model that best fits your needs. All are billed identically based on compute usage.

| Product   | Description                                                      | Ideal Use Cases                                         |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Functions   | Stateless, event-driven code that responds to HTTP requests.     | APIs, webhooks, microservices.                          |
| Containers  | Full control over your runtime environment with Docker containers.| Long-running services, custom environments.             |
| Actors      | Resilient, stateful services that maintain state between requests.| WebSocket servers, game backends, real-time collaboration. |


{/* ## Usage Pricing

Regardless of the product you choose, billing is based on the same compute metrics.

## FAQ

### How is usage calculated?
Usage is calculated based on actual resource consumption, including compute time, memory usage, and network bandwidth.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?
Yes, you can change your plan at any time. Changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

### Do you offer volume discounts?
Yes, we offer volume discounts for larger deployments. Contact our sales team for more information.

### What is the minimum compute allocation?
You can allocate as little as 1/8th of a CPU core.
