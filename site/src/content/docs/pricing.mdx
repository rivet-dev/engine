# Billing

## Choose Your Primitive

Deploy your application using the model that best fits your needs. All are billed identically based on compute usage.

| Primitive   | Description                                                      | Ideal Use Cases                                         |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Functions   | Stateless, event-driven code that responds to HTTP requests.     | APIs, webhooks, microservices.                          |
| Containers  | Full control over your runtime environment with Docker containers.| Long-running services, custom environments.             |
| Actors      | Resilient, stateful services that maintain state between requests.| WebSocket servers, game backends, real-time collaboration. |


## Unified Compute Pricing

Regardless of the primitive you choose, billing is based on the same compute metrics.

| Resource        | Pricing                              | Notes                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute         | $0.00000000163 per millisecond       | Billed by the millisecond; scales to zero when idle.        |
| Bandwidth       | $0.05 per GB                         | Each deployment includes 10GB of pooled bandwidth.          |
| Storage Reads   | 1M included, then $0.20 per million  | Fast global reads.                                         |
| Storage Writes  | 1M included, then $1.00 per million  | Durable object storage.                                    |
| Stored Data     | $0.20 per GB-month                   | Long-term state storage.                                   |
