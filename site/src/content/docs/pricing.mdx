# Billing

## Choose Your Primitive

Deploy your application using the model that best fits your needs. All are billed identically based on compute usage.

| Primitive   | Description                                                      | Ideal Use Cases                                         |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Functions   | Stateless, event-driven code that responds to HTTP requests.     | APIs, webhooks, microservices.                          |
| Containers  | Full control over your runtime environment with Docker containers.| Long-running services, custom environments.             |
| Actors      | Resilient, stateful services that maintain state between requests.| WebSocket servers, game backends, real-time collaboration. |


## Usage Pricing

Regardless of the primitive you choose, billing is based on the same compute metrics.

| Resource        | Pricing                              | Notes                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute         | $0.00000001119 per core-millisecond      | Billed by the millisecond; scales to zero when idle.        |
| Bandwidth       | $0.05 per GB                         | Each deployment includes 10GB of pooled bandwidth.          |
| Storage Reads   | 1M included, then $0.20 per million  | Fast global reads.                                         |
| Storage Writes  | 1M included, then $1.00 per million  | Durable object storage.                                    |
| Stored Data     | $0.20 per GB-month                   | Long-term state storage.                                   |

## Sample Scenarios

| Use Case                              | Setup                        | Core-ms Used (1/8th core) | Monthly Cost |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 1M function calls @ 50ms each          | Function using 1/8th core    | 1M × 50ms = 50M → /8 = 6.25M | $0.07       |
| Always-on microservice (24/7)          | Container running continuously | 2.592B ms → /8 = 324M    | $3.63       |
| Multiplayer actor swarm                | 500 actors × 30min/day on 1/8th core | 27B ms → /8 = 3.375B | $37.76      |
| Compute-heavy job (10h burst)          | 1/8th core for 10 hours      | 36M ms → /8 = 4.5M        | $0.05       |

## FAQ

### How is usage calculated?
Usage is calculated based on actual resource consumption, including compute time, memory usage, and network bandwidth.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?
Yes, you can change your plan at any time. Changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

### Do you offer volume discounts?
Yes, we offer volume discounts for larger deployments. Contact our sales team for more information.

### What is the minimum compute allocation?
You can allocate as little as 1/8th of a CPU core.
