# Helper Types

Rivet provides several TypeScript helper types to make it easier to work with actors in a type-safe way.

## `Context` Types

When working with actors, you often need to access the context object. Rivet provides helper types to extract the context types from actor definitions.

### `ActorContextOf<ActorDefinition>`

Extracts the full actor context type from an actor definition. This is the type of the context object (`c`) available in [lifecycle hooks](/docs/actors/lifecycle) and in [actions](/docs/actors/actions).

```typescript
import { actor, ActorContextOf } from "@rivetkit/actor";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { messages: [] },
  actions: {
  onStart: (c, message) => {
    // Can ActorContext be used in lifecycle hooks
    exampleFunction(c, "Actor started");
  },
  actions: {
    sendMessage: (c, message) => {
      // Can ActorContext also be used in actions
      processChatRoomContext(c, mssage);
    }
  }
});

// Now you can use this type elsewhere
function logMessage(context: ActorContextOf<typeof chatRoom>, message: string) {
  console.log(context.state.messages);
  context.broadcast("newEvent", { type: "system", message });
}
```

### `ActionContextOf<ActorDefinition>`

Extracts the action context type from an actor definition. This is the type of the context object (`c`) available in [actions](/docs/actors/actions). This cannot be used in [lifecycle hooks](/docs/actors/lifecycle).

```typescript
import { actor, ActionContextOf } from "@rivetkit/actor";

const counterWithProcessing = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  actions: {
    increment: (c) => {
      // Use our helper function to process the context
      processCounterAction(c);
      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});

function processCounterAction(context: ActionContextOf<typeof counter>) {
  context.state.count++;
}
```
