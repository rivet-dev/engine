# Ephemeral Variables

In addition to persisted state, Rivet provides a way to store ephemeral data that is not saved to permanent storage using `vars`. This is useful for temporary data that only needs to exist while the actor is running or data that cannot be serialized.

`vars` is designed to complement `state`, not replace it. Most actors should use both: `state` for critical business data and `vars` for ephemeral or non-serializable data.

## Initializing Variables

There are two ways to define an actor's initial vars:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Static Initial Variables">

Define an actor vars as a constant value:

```typescript
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

// Define vars as a constant
const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  // Define ephemeral variables
  vars: { 
    lastAccessTime: 0,
    emitter: createNanoEvents()
  },
  
  actions: {
    // ...
  }
});
```

This value will be cloned for every new actor using `structuredClone`.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Dynamic Initial Variables">

Create actor state dynamically on each actors' start:

```typescript
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

// Define vars with initialization logic
const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  // Define vars using a creation function
  createVars: () => {
    return { 
      lastAccessTime: Date.now(),
      emitter: createNanoEvents()
    };
  },
  
  actions: {
    // ...
  }
});
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Variables

Vars can be accessed and modified through the context object with `c.vars`:

```typescript
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";
import { createNanoEvents } from "nanoevents";

const counter = actor({
  // Persistent state - saved to storage
  state: { count: 0 },
  
  // Create ephemeral objects that won't be serialized
  createVars: () => {
    // Create an event emitter (can't be serialized)
    const emitter = createNanoEvents();
    
    // Set up event listener directly in createVars
    emitter.on('count-changed', (newCount) => {
      console.log(`Count changed to: ${newCount}`);
    });
    
    return { emitter };
  },
  
  actions: {
    increment: (c) => {
      // Update persistent state
      c.state.count += 1;
      
      // Use non-serializable emitter
      c.vars.emitter.emit('count-changed', c.state.count);
      
      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});
```

## When to Use `vars` vs `state`

In practice, most actors will use both: `state` for critical business data and `vars` for ephemeral or non-serializable data.

Use `vars` when:

- You need to store temporary data that doesn't need to survive restarts
- You need to maintain runtime-only references that can't be serialized (database connections, event emitters, class instances, etc.)

Use `state` when:

- The data must be preserved across actor sleeps, restarts, updates, or crashes
- The information is essential to the actor's core functionality and business logic
