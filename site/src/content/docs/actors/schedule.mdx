# Schedule

Scheduling is used to trigger events in the future. The actor scheduler is like `setTimeout`, except the timeout will persist even if the actor restarts, upgrades, or crashes.

<Warning>
	Scheduling is supported on the Rivet Cloud, Cloudflare Workers, file system, and memory drivers.

	Follow [this issue](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivetkit/issues/1095) for Redis support.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

Scheduling is helpful for long-running timeouts like month-long billing periods or account trials.

## Scheduling

### `c.schedule.after(duration, actionName, ...args)`

Schedules a function to be executed after a specified duration. This function persists across actor restarts, upgrades, or crashes.

Parameters:

- `duration` (number): The delay in milliseconds.
- `actionName` (string): The name of the action to be executed.
- `...args` (unknown[]): Additional arguments to pass to the function.

### `c.schedule.at(timestamp, actionName, ...args)`

Schedules a function to be executed at a specific timestamp. This function persists across actor restarts, upgrades, or crashes.

Parameters:

- `timestamp` (number): The exact time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch when the function should be executed.
- `actionName` (string): The name of the action to be executed.
- `...args` (unknown[]): Additional arguments to pass to the function.

## Full Example

```typescript
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

const reminderService = actor({
  state: {
    reminders: {}
  },
  
  actions: {
    setReminder: (c, userId, message, delayMs) => {
      const reminderId = crypto.randomUUID();
      
      // Store the reminder in state
      c.state.reminders[reminderId] = {
        userId,
        message,
        scheduledFor: Date.now() + delayMs
      };
      
      // Schedule the sendReminder action to run after the delay
      c.schedule.after(delayMs, "sendReminder", reminderId);
      
      return { reminderId };
    },
    
    sendReminder: (c, reminderId) => {
      const reminder = c.state.reminders[reminderId];
      if (!reminder) return;
      
      // Send reminder notification
      if (c.conns.length > 0) {
        // Send the reminder to all connected clients
        c.conns.forEach(conn => {
          conn.send("reminder", {
            message: reminder.message,
            scheduledAt: reminder.scheduledFor
          });
        });
      } else {
        // User is offline, send an email notification
        sendEmail(/* ... */);
      }
      
      // Clean up the processed reminder
      delete c.state.reminders[reminderId];
    }
  }
});
```
