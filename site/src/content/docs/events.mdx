# Events

Events are used for clients to receive realtime data from actors.

<Info>
    Only actors can publish events to clients. Clients must call RPCs to communicate with the actor.
</Info>

## Publishing from actors

Actors can publish events to clients using `this.broadcast` and `connection.send`.

### Broadcasting events

Actors can publish events to all connected clients with `this.broadcast(name, data)`. For example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "chat_room.ts" }}
class ChatRoom extends Actor {
    sendMessage(message: string) {
        this.broadcast("newMessage", { message });
    }
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = client.withTags<ChatRoom>({ name: "chat_room" });
await actor.sendMessage("Hello, world!");
```
</CodeGroup>

### Sending events to specific connections

Actors can send messages to specific client connections. All connections are available on the `this.connections` array. For example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "chat_room.ts" }}
class ChatRoom extends Actor {
    sendPrivateMessage(connectionId: number, message: string) {
        const conn = this.connections.find(c => c.id == connectionId);
        conn.send("newMessage", { message });
    }
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = client.withTags<ChatRoom>({ name: "chat_room" });
await actor.sendPrivateMessage(123, "Hello, world!");
```
</CodeGroup>

## Subscribing from clients

Clients can subscribe to events from actors using `on` and `once`.

### `on`

Clients can subscribe to events that will happen repeatedly using `actor.on(name, callback)`.

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = client.withTags<ChatRoom>({ name: "chat_room" });
actor.on("newMessage", ({ message }) => {
    console.log("Message", message);
});
```

```typescript {{ "title": "chat_room.ts" }}
class ChatRoom extends Actor {
    sendMessage(message: string) {
        this.broadcast("newMessage", { message });
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### `once`

Clients can listen for an event only one time with `actor.once(name, callback)`.

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = client.withTags<ChatRoom>({ name: "chat_room" });
actor.once("joinRequestApproved", () => {  // This will only be called once
    console.log("Join request accepted");
});
await actor.requestJoin();
```

```typescript {{ "title": "chat_root.ts" }}
class ChatRoom extends Actor {
    requestJoin() {
        // ...ask the admin to approve the request...
    }

    approveJoinRequest(connectionId: number) {
        const conn = this.connections.find(c => c.id == connectionId);
        conn.send("joinRequestApproved");
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connections

Connections are used to communicate with clients from the actor.
