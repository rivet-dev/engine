# Setup Dev Tunnel

This guide will show you how to set up a dev tunnel (similar to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) for developing
Rivet locally.

This will run a Terraform plan to deploy two components:

- A server on Linode that will forward traffic to your local machine
- A Docker container that will connect to the remote server over SSH and expose a reverse tunnel

## Prerequisites

Make sure to run `nix-shell` for all subsequent commands.

- Docker
- Linode API Key
  - Scope: `Linodes: Read/Write, Firewall: Read/Write`

## Step 1: Create Dev Tunnel

```sh
task dev-tunnel:up
```

This will prompt you to past your Linode API token. Running this will create a new `Nanode 1 GB` instance on
Linode.

Once complete, this will print an IP to your console like:

```toml
ip = "1.2.3.4"
```

## Step 2: Update public IP

Open your namespace config in `namespaces/dev.toml`.

- Update `cluter.single_node.public_ip` to the IP from the last step. By default, the config is generated with
  `public_ip = "127.0.0.1"`.
- If exists, delete the line that says `api_http_port = 8080`.
- Validate that there are no ports overridden (i.e. `cluter.single_node.api_http_port`).

If you need your IP again, run `task dev-tunnel:get-ip`.

## Step 3: Update infrastructure

To deploy the new DNS records & configs, run:

```sh
bolt infra up
```

## Step 4: Valdiate deployment

Validate you can reach your local server on the public IP, replace `MY_TUNNEL_IP` with the IP from the last
step:

```sh
curl MY_TUNNEL_IP:80
```

This should return a 404 response:

```
404 page not found
```

This means your server is now accessible.

If you have DNS configured, you should be able to reach your server from `api.my

## Cleanup

```sh
task dev-tunnel:down
```
