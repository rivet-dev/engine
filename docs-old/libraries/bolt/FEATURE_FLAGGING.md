# Feature Flagging

It's common to leave features disabled behind a feature flag. This is common when either:

- Merging code that isn't ready to deploy ([see pull request goals](/docs/processes/PULL_REQUESTS.md))
- Enabling niche features
- Enabling multiple providers (e.g. swappable email provider of Resend vs SendGrid)

## Adding config flags

Add a namespace config flag [here](/lib/bolt/config/src/ns.rs)

Validate the following:

- Make this does not break the `bolt config gen` command for a fresh config
- Make sure the flag defaults to disabled (usually)
- Make sure the Rust config code is documented
