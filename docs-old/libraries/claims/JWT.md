# Auth

Rivet uses JWT for managing authentication.

See [token-create](/svc/token-create/src/main.rs) and [auth.rs](/svc/api/auth/src/route/auth.rs) for more
details.

## Entitlements

Entitlements define what a token can do. A token can have multiple entitlements.

## Issuer

Token issuers are formatted as `gg.rivet.svc.[SERVICE_NAME]`.

## Expirations

- A user auth token expires after 15 minutes.
- A refresh token expires after 90 days.

## Security

- A refresh token is stored in a cookie so it cannot be accessed from JS.
- The client will fetch a temporary token from the auth server (which reads the refresh token from the cookie)
  and use that for any subsequent requests.
- The client will automatically fetch a new token from the auth server when the old token expires.
