# DNS & TLS Configuration

## TLS Cert

- Can only have 1 wildcard
  - i.e. `*.lobby.{dc_id}.rivet.run`
- Takes a long time to issue
- Prone to Lets Encrypt downtime and [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/)

### DNS record

- Must point to the IP of the datacenter we need
  - i.e. `*.lobby.{dc_id}.rivet.run` goes to the GG Node for the given datacenter
  - `*.rivet.run` will not work as a static DNS record because you canâ€™t point it at a single datacenter

### GG host resolution

- When a request hits the GG server for HTTP(S) or TCP+TLS requests, we need to be able to resolve the lobby
  to send it to
- This is why the lobby ID Needs to be in the DNS name
- Uses hostname to route to a specific lobby: `{lobby_id}-{port}.lobby.{dc_id}.rivet.run`

### GG autoscaling

- The IPs that the DNS records point to change frequently as GG nodes scale up and down

## Design

### DNS records

[Source](../../../packages/services/cluster/worker/src/workers/server_dns_create.rs)

Dynamically create a DNS record for each GG node formatted like `*.lobby.{dc_id}.rivet.run`. Example:

```bash
A *.lobby.51f3d45e-693f-4470-b86d-66980edd87ec.rivet.run 1.2.3.4	# DC foo, GG node 1
A *.lobby.51f3d45e-693f-4470-b86d-66980edd87ec.rivet.run 5.6.7.8	# DC foo, GG node 2
A *.lobby.51f3d45e-693f-4470-b86d-66980edd87ec.rivet.run 9.10.11.12	# DC bar, GG node 1
```

These the IPs of these records change as the GG nodes scale up and down, but the origin stays the same.

### TLS certs

[Source](../../../packages/services/cluster/worker/src/workers/datacenter_tls_issue.rs)

Each datacenter needs a TLS cert. For the example above, we need a TLS cert for
`*.lobby.51f3d45e-693f-4470-b86d-66980edd87ec.rivet.run` and
`*.lobby.51f3d45e-693f-4470-b86d-66980edd87ec.rivet.run`.

## TLS

### TLS cert provider

Currently we use Lets Encrypt as our TLS certificate provider.

Alternatives:

- ZeroSSL
  - Higher rate limits, better cert issuing

### TLS cert refreshing

Right now, the TLS certs are issued in the Terraform plan. Eventually, TLS certs should renew on their own
automatically.

## TLS Alternative

### Use `*.rivet.run` TLS cert with custom DNS server

Create a `NS` record for `*.rivet.run` pointed at our custom DNS server and use a single static TLS cert. We
did not go through with this because there is added security risk and complexity with running your own DNS
server.
