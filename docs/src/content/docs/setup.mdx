# Initial Setup

This guide will walk you through creating, deploying, and connecting to a simple Rivet Actor.

## Install CLI

```sh
TODO
```

## Initialize Project

 Create a new project:

```sh
rivet init
```

Follow the instructions to setup your project.

This will create a few files:

- `rivet.json[c]` This configures how your app is deployed to Rivet.
- `hello_world.ts` This is an example actor. This will be deployed in the next step.

## Deploy project

Deploy your project to Rivet with:

```sh
rivet deploy
```

<Note>
    If self-hosting, this will prompt you to input a custom API address.
</Note>

This will print an endpoint that you can connect to.

You can test this by using the Rivet CLI:

TODO: This is not implemented yet, find a cleaner way of testing this, maybe just give client code

```sh
rivet actor connect --tags name=hello_world
```

## Setup your editor/IDE (optional)

Rivet actors run on the [Deno](https://deno.com/) runtime.  Read their guide on how to configure your IDE [here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/#using-an-editoride).

## Setup client

To setup a client, follow the guide for [JavaScript/TypeScript](/docs/javascript).
