# State

Actor data is isolated to itself and cannot be accessed from other actors or clients. All reads & writes to state are done via [RPC](/docs/rpc).

Actor state provides the best of both worlds: it's stored in-memory and persisted automatically. This lets you work with the data without added latency while still being able to survive crashes & upgrades.

There are two ways of storing actor data:

- **Native state** data is the most common persistence mechanism. State is a native JavaScript object stored in memory.
- **Key-Value (KV)** data allows you deal with larger datasets than cannot fit in memory.

## Native state

State is a native JavaScript object stored in-memory on `this.state`. This makes building realtime & stateful applications as simple as updating native JavaScript objects.

### State type

Actor states can be typed in TypeScript using the first generic argument on `Actor<State>`. For example:

```typescript
interface State {
    count: number;
}

class Counter extends Actor<State> {
    // ...
}
```

### Initializing state

Each requires an `initializeState` method. This is only called once when the actor is created.

For example:

```typescript
interface State {
    count: number;
}

class Counter extends Actor<State> {
    initializeState() {
        return { count: 0 };
    }
}
```

### State saves

Rivet automatically handles persisting state transparently to recover from a crash or upgrade. This happens at the end of every remote procedure call if the state has changed.

In the rare occasion you need to force a state change mid-RPC, you can use `forceSaveState`. This should only be used if your remote procedure call makes an important state change that needs to be persisted before the RPC exits in case of a crash.

### Valid data types

Only JSON-serializable types can be stored in state. State is persisted under the hood in a compact, binary format. This is because JavaScript classes cannot be serialized & deserialized.

### Limitations

State is constrained to the available memory (see [limitations](/docs/limitations)). For larger datasets, use KV.

## Key-Value (KV)

The KV state is used for storing large datasets that cannot fit in to memory.

<Info>
    KV is specific to each actor and is not global. To fetch data from other actors, use [RPC](/docs/rpc).

    If you need a shared state, you have two options:

    1. Create an actor that holds the shared state that actors can make RPCs to
    2. Use an external database, such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Performance

KV stores native JavaScript values in a compact binary format, so you don't need to worry about writing extra serialization & deserialization code.
