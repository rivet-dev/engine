# JavaScript & TypeScript

This guide will walk you through setting up JavaScript/TypeScript client & connect to an actor.

<Warning>
    Make sure you've already deployed a Rivet Actor. If you haven't, follow the [setup guide](/docs/setup) first.
</Warning>

## Install client package

Install the Rivet actor package with:

<CodeGroup>
```sh {{ "title": "npm" }}
npx jsr add @rivet-gg/actors-client
```

```sh {{ "title": "Yarn" }}
# This doesn't use `yarn add` since the packages is hosted on jsr.io.
yarn dlx jsr add @rivet-gg/actors-client
```

```sh {{ "title": "pnpm" }}
pnpm dlx jsr add @rivet-gg/esbuild-deno-loader
```

```sh {{ "title": "Deno" }}
deno add jsr:@rivet-gg/actors-client
```

```sh {{ "title": "Bun" }}
bunx jsr add @rivet-gg/esbuild-deno-loader
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    These commands don't use the usual `npm install`/`yarn add`/etc since `@rivet-gg/actors-client` package is hosted on jsr.io, a portable alternative to NPM.
</Info>

### Get connection address

Fetch the connection address using the Rivet CLI. Copy this value for the next step.

TODO: This is wrong

```sh
rivet get-address
```

### Connect to actor

Use this code to create & connect to the actor. Replace `/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */` with the value from the previous step.

```typescript
import Client from "@rivet-gg/actors-client";
const client = new Client(/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */);

const counter = await client.withTags({ name: "hello_world" });  // Get or create a `hello_world` actor
const newCount = await counter.increment(5);  // Call the method `increment` on the `hello_world` actor
console.log("New count", newCount);
```

You can view the actor state with:
