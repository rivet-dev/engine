# Fault Tolerance

Rivet actors are designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient to various types of failures. This guide explains how actors handle different failure scenarios and how to build reliable applications.

## Actor crashes

When an actor crashes, Rivet automatically starts the actor again with a backoff. The actor's state will still be there when it restarts. `onStart` will be called when the actor starts again.

## Hardware and System Faults

While uncommon, hardware faults and system faults can cause an actor to crash. Rivet is designed to handle these scenarios by automatically restarting the actor with a backoff.

## Actor state

Actor state is automatically restored on startup.

## Client connection handling

See [connection docs](/docs/connections).
