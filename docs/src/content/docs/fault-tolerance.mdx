# Fault Tolerance

Rivet actors are designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient to various types of failures. This guide explains how actors handle different failure scenarios and how to build reliable applications.

## Actor crashes

- When an actor crashes, Rivet [automatically starts the actor again](/docs/rescheduling) (with an [exponential backoff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/retry-backoff.html)).
- The actor's state will still be there when it restarts.
- `onStart` will be called when the actor starts again.

## Hardware and System Faults

While uncommon, hardware and system faults can cause an actor to crash. Rivet is designed to handle these scenarios by [automatically restarting the actor](/docs/rescheduling). (with an [exponential backoff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/retry-backoff.html)).

## Actor state

Actor state is automatically restored on startup. Read more [here](/docs/state).

## Client reconnection on crash

See [connection docs](/docs/connections).
