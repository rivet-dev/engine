# Edge Networking

Actors can run in many regions around the world. By default, actors will choose the most optimal region based on the client's latency. This can be overridden if needed.

## Available regions

See available regions [here](/docs/regions).

## Region selection

TODO: Validate this

```typescript
const actor = client.withTags({ name: "example" }, {
    create: {
        region: "atl"
    }
});
```
