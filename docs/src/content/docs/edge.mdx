# Edge Networking

Actors can run in 8 regions around the world.

## Available regions

See available regions [here](/docs/regions).

## Fetching regions via API

This region list can be fetched with `GET https://api.rivet.gg/regions`.

## Automatic region selection

By default, actors will choose the most optimal region based on the client's latency. This can be overridden if needed.

## Region selection

TODO: Validate this

```typescript
const actor = client.withTags({ name: "example" }, {
    create: {
        region: "atl"
    }
});
```
