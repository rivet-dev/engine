# Intro to Rivet

Rivet is a powerful platform for building real-time applications, offering a simplified approach to distributed computing. With built-in support for remote procedure calls, events, state, and edge networking, Rivet makes it easy to build scalable real-time applications.

Common use cases include multiplayer tools, local-first apps, AI agents, running untrusted user code, dedicated game servers, and more.

## Platform Features

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Performance        | Built for speed with in-memory state, minimal network hops, and edge deployment capabilities    |
| Simplified Architecture | Replace complex infrastructure (caches, queues, pubsub) with a simple actor-based model         |
| Resource Efficiency     | Zero cost when idle - actors automatically sleep and wake instantly on demand                   |
| Fault Tolerance         | Built-in durability preserves state across crashes & upgrades with automatic failure isolation  |
| Edge Computing          | Deploy globally with automatic region selection to minimize latency for users                   |
| Reduced DevOps          | Minimal DevOps overhead with environment management, built-in monitoring, and automatic scaling |

## Core Capabilities

| Capability                                | Benefit                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)](/docs/rpc) | Build distributed function calls across your application with minimal boilerplate      |
| [State & Persistence](/docs/state)        | Store and retrieve data with automatic persistence and state management                |
| [Event System](/docs/events)              | Handle real-time updates and state changes with a built-in pub/sub system              |
| [Edge Networking](/docs/edge)             | Deploy your applications globally with automatic edge distribution                     |
| [Scaling & Concurrency](/docs/scaling)    | Automatically scale actors across compute resources with built-in concurrency controls |
| [Fault Tolerance](/docs/fault-tolerance)  | Build resilient applications with automatic failover and recovery                      |

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "counter.ts" }}
// This state is associated with each actor. State is stored in-memory, but is
// automatically persisted & survives crashes/upgrades.
interface State {
  totalCount: 0;
}

class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  // Create the initial state when creating a new actor
  initializeState() {
    return { totalCount: 0 };
  }

  // Define a remote procedure call (RPC)
  increment(count: number) {
    // Update state. This is automatically persisted.
    this.state.totalCount += count;

    // Broadcast new count to all connections using the event system.
    this.broadcast("newCount", this.state.totalCount);

    return this.state.totalCount;
  }
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
// Connect to counter actor
const client = new Client(/* Rivet endpoint */);
const counter = await client.withTags({ name: "counter" });

// Listen for events
counter.on("newCount", count => console.log("Broadcasted new count"));

// Call the actor's RPC
const newCount = await counter.increment(42);
console.log("RPC response", newCount);
```
