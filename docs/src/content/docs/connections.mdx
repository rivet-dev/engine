# Connections

Connections represent client connections to your actor. They provide a way to handle client authentication, manage connection-specific data, and control the connection lifecycle.

## Parameters

When clients connect to an actor, they can pass connection parameters that are handled during the connection process. These parameters are typed using the `ConnectionParams` interface.

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ "title": "actor.ts" }}
interface ConnectionParams {
  authToken: string;  // Example parameter
}

class Example extends Actor<State, ConnectionData, ConnectionParams> {
  // ...
}
```

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const actor = client.get("example", {}, {
  parameters: { authToken: "supersekure" }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connection Data

Each connection can store custom data that persists throughout its lifetime. This data is defined using the `ConnectionData` interface and is set during the connection process.

The connection data can be accessed in any actor method using `connection.data`.

For example:

```typescript {{ "title": "actor.ts" }}
interface ConnectionData {
  userId: string;
  role: string;
}

class Example extends Actor<State, ConnectionData> {
  // The data returned from `onConnect` will be assigned to the `conn.data`
  onConnect(conn: Connection<ConnectionData>) {
    return { userId: 123, role: "admin" };
  }

  // ...
}
```


## Lifecycle

### `onConnect`

The `onConnect` lifecycle method is called whenever a new client attempts to connect. It serves as middleware before allowing clients to interact with your actor.


For example:

```typescript
class Example extends Actor<State, ConnectionData> {
  async onConnect(
    connection: Connection<ConnectionData>,
    params: ConnectionParams
  ): Promise<ConnectionData> {
    // Handle connection setup
    // Return connection data to store with the connection
    return {
      userId: "user123",
      role: "user"
    };
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  `onConnect` can be used to authenticate new connections, read more [here](/docs/authentication).
</Tip>

### `onDisconnect`

The `onDisconnect` method is called when a client disconnects from the actor. For example:

```typescript
class Example extends Actor<State, ConnectionData> {
  async onDisconnect(connection: Connection<ConnectionData>): Promise<void> {
    // Clean up any connection-specific resources
    console.log(`User ${connection.data.userId} disconnected`);
  }
}
```

## Connection List

All active connections can be accessed with `this.connections`.  This is frequently used with `conn.send(name, event)` to send messages directly to clients.

## Disconnecting clients

TODO: This is not yet implemented

Connections can be disconnected with:

```typescript
connection.disconnect();
```

## Offline & reconnection behavior

Clients automatically attempt to reconnect (with [exponential backoff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/retry-backoff.html)) when disconnected. Remote procedure calls made while disconnected are queued.

On reconnection, event subscriptions are reestablished & queued RPCs are executed.
