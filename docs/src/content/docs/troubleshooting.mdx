# Troubleshooting

## Accessing source maps

Update your configuration to include `unstable.minify = false` and `unstable.dump_build = true`.

```json {{ "title": "rivet.json" }}
{
	"builds": [
		{
			"tags": { "name": "counter" },
			"access": "public",
			"runtime": "javascript",
			"script": "counter.ts",
			"accesss": "public",
			"unstable": {
				"minify": false,
				"dump_build": true
			}
		}
	]
}
```

<Tip>
    `unstable.minify = false` is not required, but it maintains symbol names & whitespace to make your backtraces easier to read.
</Tip>

After you deploy again, you'll see a new line in your output:

```sh
$ rivet deploy
...etc...
[Build Path] /var/folders/hh/qn66rcl906gg79xjk27qhg900000gn/T/.tmpX5Jcer
...etc...
```

Inside the build folder printed above (e.g. `/var/folders/hh/qn66rcl906gg79xjk27qhg900000gn/T/.tmpX5Jcer`), you'll find both:

- `index.js` The file that's running on the server. You can manually look up your backtraces in this file.
- `index.js.map` The source map for your code. You can look up the backtrace in this

### Resolving a location in the source map

To look up the location `file:///index.js:3754:17`, you can:

1. `cd` to the build path (see above)
2. Run:

    ```sh
    $ npx source-map-cli resolve index.js.map 3754 17
    Maps to ../../../../../../Users/nathan/rivet/ee/oss/examples/counter/counter.ts:39:14

        console.log(new Error("foo"));
                ^
    ```
