# Rust Workaround

## Overview

This issue is specific to Apple Silicon machines.

Dev containers have a bug with incremental builds which lead to nonsensical Rust errors.

These are documented in better detail here:

## Moving target dir out of mounted dir

In order to fix this, we move the target path to `/target` which is not mounted to the host system. This way the virtual fs does not trigger issues with Rust.

This complicates things, since we now compile binaries in non-standard paths.

This is done by updating `devcontainer.json` to:

-   Overriding `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to `/target`
-   Updating `PATH` to include `/target/debug` and `/target/release` so we can still access `bolt`
