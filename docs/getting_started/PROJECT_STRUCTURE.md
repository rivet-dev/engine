```

When making a new endpoint, you'll need to add files in the following locations:

1. **API Definition**: `fern/definition/<my-pkg>/<endpoint>/__package.yml`: This is where the API definition goes.

1. **API Router**: `svc/api/<my-pkg>/src/route/mod.rs`: This might call an `op!` or a `msg!` from the business logic.

1. **API Endpoint**: `svc/pkg/<my-pkg>/src/route/<endpoint>.rs`: The handler for the route goes here.

1. **Business Logic**: `svc/pkg/<my-pkg>`: This is where the actual business logic goes.

    participant Client as Client
    participant API_Router as API Router (svc/api/<my-pkg>/src/route/mod.rs)
    participant API_Endpoint as API Endpoint (svc/pkg/<my-pkg>/src/route/<endpoint>.rs)
    participant Business_Logic as Business Logic (svc/pkg/<my-pkg>)

    Client->>API_Router: Request
    API_Router->>API_Endpoint: Forward request
    API_Endpoint->>Business_Logic: Call business logic
    Business_Logic-->>API_Endpoint: Return result
    API_Endpoint-->>API_Router: Return result
    API_Router-->>Client: Response
```

Notes:
- When working on endpoints, you need to include crates for adding ops, messages, and other dependencies.
