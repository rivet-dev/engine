## Prerequisites

**The following should be installed in a dedicated VM for Rivet.**

-   Debian 11 (other Linux distros untested)
    -   Accessible from public IP
    -   Recommended: [Firewalls](/docs/getting_started/DEVELOPMENT_FIREWALLS.md)

## Step 1: Install dependencies

### [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

_Docker is required to run Rivet services._

See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for install instructions.

### [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html)

_Nix is required to set up the development environment._

Run:

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

See [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for install instructions.

## Step 2: Clone repository

Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet.git
```

> **Warp compatibility**
>
> Warp may have issues with the Nix installer since it does not use the default shell. [Read more.](https://docs.warp.dev/features/ssh)

## Step 3: Boot cluster

Run:

```
nix-shell --run "bolt init dev --yes"
```

This will:

1. Prompt you for parameters to generate your cluster's config
2. Provision required infrastructure for the cluster

Run this command any time you update to a new version of Rivet.

> **Tip**
>
> See the `namespaces/dev.toml` and `secrets/dev.toml` file to see the generated namespace configs.

## Step 4: Boot the Rivet Hub

Now, you have to start the hub frontend.

1. Clone the [Rivet Hub](https://github.com/rivet-gg/hub) with
2. Create a file called `.env` in the root of the `hub` repo
    - Set `RIVET_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080` in the `.env` file
3. Start the hub
4. Visit http://localhost:5080
5. Register an account with your email

## Step 5: Promote yourself to admin

```
nix-shell --run "bolt db sh db-user --query 'UPDATE users SET is_admin = true'"
```

You may need to clear the local cache for this change to appear. ([Related issue](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/issues/152))

_This command sets all users to admin. We're assuming you're the only user in the cluster. Do not run this command again._

## Step 6: Create a developer group

You should now see a "Create Group" button on the hub. Proceed to create a group and start developing.
