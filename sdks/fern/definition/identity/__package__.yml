      docs: Gets or creates an identity.

        Passing an existing identity token in the body refreshes the
        token.

        Temporary Accounts

        Until the identity is linked with the Rivet Hub (see
        `PrepareGameLink`), this identity will be temporary but still behave
        like all other identities.

        This is intended to allow users to play the game without signing
        up while still having the benefits of having an account. When they are
        ready to save their account, they should be instructed to link their
        account (see `PrepareGameLink`).

        Storing Token

        `identity_token` should be stored in some form of persistent
        storage. The token should be read from storage and passed to
        `Setup` every time the client starts.

          Token has a 90 day TTL. 
          This means that if `rivet.api.identity#Setup` is not called again within 90 days, the token will no longer be valid. 
          If this happens, the user can recover their account through the linking process (see `rivet.api.identity#PrepareGameLink`). 
          This token should be stored locally and never sent to a server or another device. 
          If this token is compromised, anyone with access to this token has control of the identity.
