types:
  Key:
    docs: >-
      A string representing a key in the key-value database.

      Maximum length of 512 characters.

      *Recommended Key Path Format*

      Key path components are split by a slash (e.g. `a/b/c` has the
      path components `["a", "b", "c"]`). Slashes can be escaped by
      using a backslash (e.g. `a/b\/c/d` has the path components
      `["a", "b/c", "d"]`).

      This format is not enforced by Rivet, but the tools built around Rivet KV
      work better if this format is used.
