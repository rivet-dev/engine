# Rivet Actor Client

Rivet Actors have built-in RPC, state, and events â€” the easiest way to build modern applications.

## Getting Started

- [Setup Guide](https://rivet.gg/docs/setup)
- [Documentation](https://rivet.gg/docs)
- [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-gg/rivet/tree/main/examples)

## Example

```typescript
import { Client } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client";
import type Counter from "./counter.ts";

const client = new Client(/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */);

// Get-or-create a counter actor
const counter = await client.get<Counter>({ name: "counter" });

// Listen for update count events (https://rivet.gg/docs/events)
counter.on("count", (count: number) => console.log("New count:", count));

// Increment the count over remote procedure call (https://rivet.gg/docs/rpc)
await counter.increment(1);

// Disconnect from the actor when finished (https://rivet.gg/docs/connections)
await counter.dispose();
```

See [setup guide](https://rivet.gg/docs/setup) for how to access `/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */`.
